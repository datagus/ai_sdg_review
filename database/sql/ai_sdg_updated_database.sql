In our work we apply such a machine learning technique to the modelling of population dynamics of red deer for the 40000 hectares co-natural manage forest area on high Karst of Notranjska in Slovenia. We used the RETIS program, a machine learning tool developed by A. Karalie at the Institute Jozef Stefan in Ljubljana. This program induces regression trees from data, and has already been applied to several ecological problems. RETIS was applied on data, collected in the period 1976-1994, which included several meteorological parameters, parameters about the state of the forest, and parameters about the population of the red deer. Given these data about the observed system, the system RETIS automatically induces a model which has the form of a regression tree. We evaluate our induced models qualitatively and quantitatively. For the qualitative evaluation, we present an expert interpretation of the models. We show that quantitatively, using the models:(we use a relative prediction error) and given the meteorological parameters during winter and summer and an estimate of the number of red deer in the area, it is possible to predict the state of the forest in the near future. This is very important for maintaining the balance between red deer population and other parameters of the forest, which will allow sustainable development of the complex forest ecosystem.','method',0,'population dynamics','means','sustainable forest management','regional','longitudinal','past; present; future','mixed','Slovenia','meteorological data, forest conditions, population of red deer','Slovenia',0),('2-s2.0-33646167815','Artificial intelligence; Engineers; Environmental impact; Mathematical models; Neural networks; Patient rehabilitation; Employ management; Infrastructure; Sustainable water mains; Underground structures','method',0,'water management','both',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Canada','historic data on temperature; rainfall; operating pressure; number of break','Canada',0),('2-s2.0-33747356756','Himalayas are ecologically fragile, and unplanned exploitation of natural resources is severely affecting water flow regimes in the mountainous watersheds. Therefore, it is imperative to quantify the effect of different environmental and morphological factors on flow behavior in the micro-watersheds to efficiently plan and execute water management practices in a sustainable manner. In this study, three hilly micro-watersheds were gauged in Uttaranchal State of India to assess the impact of morphological characteristics and land uses on surface runoff, base flow and total flow. Artificial intelligence (AI) models based on the multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) technique were employed to predict surface runoff, base flow, and total flow as affected by rainfall and morphological features of the micro-watersheds. Daily rainfall, runoff, base flow, and total flow data recorded from July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2003 in the three watersheds, were used to develop and validate MARS models. The average correlation coefficients between the observed and predicted runoff, base flow, and total flow for the unseen test datasets were 0.573, 0.884, and 0.881, respectively. The corresponding average deviations were -0.113, -0.02, and -0.04 mm, and the average absolute deviations were 0.171, 0.187, and 0.267 mm, respectively. Thus, the analysis revealed that base flows and total flows, as predicted by MARS, were in close agreement with the observed values while the surface runoff predictions were reasonable at best. MARS analysis determined that 5-day antecedent precipitation index (API5), rainfall, day of the year, runoff estimated by using curve number method, and watershed area are the most important variables for simulating runoff in hilly watersheds. Soil cover and watershed geometry parameters also affected runoff generation which are indirectly covered in the estimation of runoff by curve number method. In order to explore applicability of MARS models on ungauged watersheds, data from two watersheds were used to develop MARS models, and tested on the third watershed. The observed and predicted values of flows were found to be in a reasonably good agreement. The correlation coefficients for the unseen test datasets varied from 0.391 to 0.648 for surface runoff, 0.736 to 0.879 for base flow, and 0.789 to 0.886 for total flow. The prediction for surface runoff can improve further if more data on surface flow events are available. Therefore, it is concluded that MARS models have the potential to simulate runoff in hilly areas and can be applied satisfactorily to ungauged watersheds under identical agro-climatic situations. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

For example, the European Union has set the target of achieving 22% of electricity generation from renewable sources by 2010. However, the extensive use of this energy source is being avoided by some technical problems as fouling and slagging in the surfaces of boiler heat exchangers. Although these phenomena were extensively studied in the last decades in order to optimize the behaviour of large coal power boilers, a simple, general and effective method for fouling control has not been developed. For biomass boilers, the feedstock variability and the presence of new components in ash chemistry increase the fouling influence in boiler performance. In particular, heat transfer is widely affected and the boiler capacity becomes dramatically reduced. Unfortunately, the classical approach of regular sootblowing cycles becomes clearly insufficient for them. Artificial Intelligence (AI) provides new means to undertake this problem. This paper illustrates a methodology based on Neural Networks (NNs) and Fuzzy-Logic Expert Systems to select the moment for activating sootblowing in an industrial biomass boiler. The main aim is to minimize the boiler energy and efficiency losses with a proper sootblowing activation. Although the NN type used in this work is well-known and the Hybrid Systems had been extensively used in the last decade, the excellent results obtained in the use of AI in industrial biomass boilers control with regard to previous approaches makes this work a novelty. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper compares multiple linear regression, time series analysis, and artificial neural networks (ANNs) as techniques for peak daily summer water demand forecast modeling. Analysis was performed on 10 years of peak daily water demand data and meteorological variables (maximum daily temperature and daily rainfall) for the summer months of May to August of each year for an area of high outdoor water usage in the city of Ottawa, Canada. Thirty-nine multiple linear regression models, nine time series models, and 39 ANN models were developed and their relative performance was compared. The artificial neural network approach is shown to provide a better prediction of peak daily summer water demand than multiple linear regression and time series analysis. The best results were obtained when peak water demand from the previous day, maximum temperature from the current and previous day, and the occurrence/nonoccurrence of rainfall from five days before, were used as input data. It was also found that the peak daily summer water demand is better correlated with the rainfall occurrence rather than the amount of rainfall itself, and that assigning a weighting system to the antecedent days of no rainfall does not result in more accurate models. © 2008 ASCE.','study object',0,'forecasting peak daily water demand','means',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Canada','The dataset used in the study consists of daily total rainfall in mm, maximum daily temperature in °C, peak daily water demand in ML/day, and population data.','United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-40849130727','Sustainable water resources management is a critically important priority across the globe. While water scarcity limits the uses of water in many ways, floods may also result in property damages and the loss of life. To more efficiently use the limited amount of water under the changing world or to resourcefully provide adequate time for flood warning, the issues have led us to seek advanced techniques for improving streamflow forecasting on a short-term basis. This study emphasizes the inclusion of sea surface temperature (SST) in addition to the spatio-temporal rainfall distribution via the Next Generation Radar (NEXRAD), meteorological data via local weather stations, and historical stream data via USGS gage stations to collectively forecast discharges in a semi-arid watershed in south Texas. Two types of artificial intelligence models, including genetic programming (GP) and neural network (NN) models, were employed comparatively. Four numerical evaluators were used to evaluate the validity of a suite of forecasting models. Research findings indicate that GP-derived streamflow forecasting models were generally favored in the assessment in which both SST and meteorological data significantly improve the accuracy of forecasting. Among several scenarios, NEXRAD rainfall data were proven its most effectiveness for a 3-day forecast, and SST Gulf-to-Atlantic index shows larger impacts than the SST Gulf-to-Pacific index on the streamflow forecasts. The most forward looking GP-derived models can even perform a 30-day streamflow forecast ahead of time with an r-square of 0.84 and RMS error 5.4 in our study. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

To illustrate the applicability and capability of an ANFIS, the River Great Menderes, located in western Turkey, is chosen as a case study area. The advantage of this method is that it uses the input-output data sets. A total of 5844 daily data sets collected from 1985 to 2000 are used for the time-series forecasting. Models having various input structures were constructed and the best structure was investigated. In addition, four various training/testing data sets were built by cross-validation methods and the best data set was obtained. The performance of the ANFIS models in training and testing sets was compared with observations and also evaluated. In order to get an accurate and reliable comparison, the best-fit model structure was also trained and tested by artificial neural networks and traditional time-series analysis techniques and the results compared. The results indicate that the ANFIS can be applied successfully and provide high accuracy and reliability for time-series modelling.

As part of the management process, it is important to assess the baseline characteristics of the marine environment so that sustainable development can be pursued. In this study, artificial neural networks (ANNs) were used to predict and forecast quantitative characteristics of water bodies. The true power and advantage of this method lie in its ability to (1) represent both linear and non-linear relationships and (2) learn these relationships directly from the data being modeled. The study focuses on Singapore coastal waters. The ANN model is built for quick assessment and forecasting of selected water quality variables at any location in the domain of interest. Respective variables measured at other locations serve as the input parameters. The variables of interest are salinity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll-a. A time lag up to 2Δt appeared to suffice to yield good simulation results. To validate the performance of the trained ANN, it was applied to an unseen data set from a station in the region. The results show the ANN\'s great potential to simulate water quality variables. Simulation accuracy, measured in the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient of efficiency (R2), ranged from 0.8 to 0.9 for the training and overfitting test data. Thus, a trained ANN model may potentially provide simulated values for desired locations at which measured data are unavailable yet required for water quality models. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To identify the appropriate conservation measures in a watershed properly, and, in particular, to augment flow during lean periods, accurate estimation of streamflow is essential. Due to the complexity of rainfall-runoff relationships in hilly watersheds and non-availability of reliable data, process-based models have limited applicability. In this study, data-driven models, based upon the Multiple Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS) technique, were employed to predict streamflow (surface runoff, baseflow and total runoff) in three mid-Himalayan micro-watersheds. In addition, the effect of length of historical records on the performance of MARS models was critically evaluated. Though acceptable MARS models could be developed with a 2-year data set, their performance improved considerably with a 3-year data set. Various indicators of model performance, such as correlation coefficient, average deviation, average absolute deviation and modelling efficiency, showed significant improvement for simulation of surface runoff, baseflow and total flow. To further analyse the versatility and general applicability of the MARS approach, 2-year data sets were used to develop the model and test it on a third-year data set to assess its performance. The models simulated the surface runoff, baseflow and total flow reasonably well and can be reliably applied in ungauged small watersheds under identical agro-climatic settings.

This study develops an integrated decision support system to assess existing office building conditions and to recommend an optimal set of sustainable renovation actions, considering trade-offs between renovation cost, improved building quality, and environmental impacts. A hybrid approach that combines A* graph search algorithm with genetic algorithms (GA) is used to analyze all possible renovation actions and their trade-offs to develop the optimal solution.

Four options that have been considered to help resolve the problem of drought in Cyprus include imposing effective water use restrictions, implementing water-demand reduction programs, optimizing water supply systems, and developing sustainable alternative water source strategies. An important aspect of these initiatives is the accurate forecasting of short-term water demands, and in particular, peak water demands. This study compared multiple linear regression and three types of multilayer perceptron artificial neural networks (each of which used a different type of learning algorithm) as methods for peak weekly water-demand forecast modeling. The analysis was performed on 6 years of peak weekly water-demand data and meteorological variables (maximum weekly temperature and total weekly rainfall) for two different regions (Athalassa and Public Garden) in the city of Nicosia, Cyprus. 20 multiple linear regression models, 20 Levenberg-Marquardt artificial neural network (ANN) models, 20 resilient back-propagation ANN models, and 20 conjugate gradient Powell-Beale ANN models were developed, and their relative performance was compared. For both the Athalassa and Public Garden regions in Nicosia, the Levenberg-Marquardt ANN method was found to provide a more accurate prediction of peak weekly water demand than the other two types of ANNs and multiple linear regression.

Indeed, there is a wide concern to the fact that an ineffi cient water management system may become one of the major drawbacks for a human-centered sustainable development process. The assessment of reservoir water quality is constrained due to geographic considerations, the number of parameters to be considered and the huge fi nancial resources needed to get such data. Under these circumstances, the modeling of water quality in reservoirs is essential in the resolution of environmental problems and has lately been asserting itself as a relevant tool for a sustainable and harmonious progress of the populations. The analysis and development of forecast models, based on Artifi cial Intelligence-based tools and the new methodologies for problem solving, has proven to be an alternative, having in mind a pro-active behavior that may contribute decisively to diagnose, preserve, and rehabilitate the reservoirs. In particular, this work describes the training, validation and application of Artifi cial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Decision Trees (DTs) to forecast the water quality of the Odivelas reservoir, in Portugal, over a period of 10 years.

Due to the fact that the number of meteorological stations where global solar radiation (GSR) is recorded, is limited in Iran we were meant to develop four distinctive models based on artificial intelligence in order to prognosticate GSR in Tehran province, Iran. Accordingly, the polynomial and radial basis function (RBF) are applied as the kernel function of Support Vector Regression (SVR) and input energies from different meteorological data obtained from the only station in the studied region were selected as the inputs of the model and the GSR was chosen as the output of the models. Instead of minimizing the observed training error, SVR-poly and SVR-rbf attempt to minimize the generalization error bound so as to achieve generalized performance. The experimental results show that an improvement in predictive accuracy and capability of generalization can be achieved by the proposed approach. The calculated root mean square error and correlation coefficient disclosed that SVR- rbf performed well in predicting GSR. Comparing SVR-rbf results with SVR-poly, ANFIS, and ANN reveals that SVR-rbf outperforms the POLY model in terms of prediction accuracy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.','method',0,'solar radiation forecasting','means','sustainable energy','national','snapshot','present','quantitative','Iran',NULL,'Iran',0),('2-s2.0-84906922678','Developing reliable methods to estimate stream baseflow has been a subject of interest due to its importance in catchment response and sustainable watershed management. However, to date, in the absence of complex numerical models, baseflow is most commonly estimated using statistically derived empirical approaches that do not directly incorporate physically-meaningful information. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools such as Genetic Programming (GP) offer unique capabilities to reduce the complexities of hydrological systems without losing relevant physical information. This study presents a simple-to-use empirical equation to estimate baseflow time series using GP so that minimal data is required and physical information is preserved. A groundwater numerical model was first adopted to simulate baseflow for a small semi-urban catchment (0.043km2) located in Singapore. GP was then used to derive an empirical equation relating baseflow time series to time series of groundwater table fluctuations, which are relatively easily measured and are physically related to baseflow generation. The equation was then generalized for approximating baseflow in other catchments and validated for a larger vegetation-dominated basin located in the US (24km2). Overall, this study used GP to propose a simple-to-use equation to predict baseflow time series based on only three parameters: minimum daily baseflow of the entire period, area of the catchment and groundwater table fluctuations. It serves as an alternative approach for baseflow estimation in un-gauged systems when only groundwater table and soil information is available, and is thus complementary to other methods that require discharge measurements. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.','study object',0,'approximating stream baseflow time series using groundwater table fluctuations','means',NULL,'supranational','snapshot','present','quantitative','multiple','discharge data from January 1990 to December 2002 for the Beaver River Basin and data from January 2013 to August 2013 for validation, as well as discharge data from September 2011 to August 2012 for Kent Ridge Catchment','Singapore',0),('2-s2.0-84911124175','Determination of water-table elevation corresponding to aquifer recharge or discharge is an important issue in sustainable groundwater management. This approach necessitates the application of numerical simulation models that may require substantial amounts of input data related to aquifer parameters and specifications, even for modeling only part of the aquifer, which makes the calculations expensive. Moreover, comprehensive aquifer modeling is a time-consuming and computationally intensive process. Artificial intelligence tools can replace simulation models and decrease computational efforts by using input and output data sets without considering complex relations of the system to be modeled. This paper employs an adaptive neural fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and genetic programming (GP) as artificial intelligence tools to extract governing groundwater flow equations in Ghaen and Karaj aquifers in Iran. For both aquifers, several input-output data sets, for both training and testing data sets, are determined by using a developed numerical simulation model [iterative alternating direction implicit method (IADIM)]. In addition, the water table elevation at each cell in the model is considered to be a function of aquifer recharge and discharge at the current period as well as water table elevation at the previous period. Application of ANFIS and GP models in these case studies illustrates the superior flexibility of GP over ANFIS in time series modeling. In fact, GP provides water-table elevation results with less root mean squared error (RMSE) as the error criterion, especially in the testing data set. Thus, GP is a good candidate for use in groundwater modeling. © 2014 American Society of Civil Engineers.','study object',0,'groundwater modeling','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','Iran',NULL,'Iran',0),('2-s2.0-84928255051','The increasing liberalization of European electricity markets, the growing proportion of intermittent renewable energy being fed into the energy grids, and also new challenges in the patterns of energy consumption (such as electric mobility) require flexible and intelligent power grids capable of providing efficient, reliable, economical, and sustainable energy production and distribution. From the supplier side, particularly, the integration of renewable energy sources (e.g., wind and solar) into the grid imposes an engineering and economic challenge because of the limited ability to control and dispatch these energy sources due to their intermittent characteristics. Time-series prediction of wind speed for wind power production is a particularly important and challenging task, wherein prediction intervals (PIs) are preferable results of the prediction, rather than point estimates, because they provide information on the confidence in the prediction. In this paper, two different machine learning approaches to assess PIs of time-series predictions are considered and compared: 1) multilayer perceptron neural networks trained with a multiobjective genetic algorithm and 2) extreme learning machines combined with the nearest neighbors approach.

Simple-cost-effective methods for quick and reliable prediction of NO3 contamination in groundwater of such agricultural systems can ensure sustainable rural development. Using 10-year time series data, the capability of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and support vector machine (SVM) models as well as six geostatistical models was assessed for predicting NO3 concentration in groundwater and its noncarcinogenic health risk. The dataset comprised 9360 water samples representing 26 different wells monitored for 10 years. The best predictions were found by SVM models which decreased prediction errors by 42–73 % compared with other models. However, using well locations and sampling date as input parameters led to the best performance of SVM model for predicting NO3 with RMSE = 4.75–8.19 mg l−1 and MBE = 3.3–5.2 mg l−1. ANFIS models ranked next with RMSE = 8.19–25.1 mg l−1 and MBE = 5.2–13.2 mg l−1 while geostatistical models led to the worst results. The created raster maps with SVM models showed that NO3 concentration in 38–97 % of the study area usually exceeded the human-affected limit of 13 mg l−1 during different seasons. Generally, risk probability went beyond 90 % except for winter when groundwater quality was safe from nitrate viewpoint. Noncarcinogenic risk exceeded the unity in about 1.13 and 6.82 % of the study area in spring and summer, respectively, indicating that long-term use of groundwater poses a significant health risk to local resident.

Decision support systems (DSS) have been used widely for handling such complexity in water treatment, having a high level of popularity as academic exercises, although little validation and few full-scale implementations reported in practice. The objective of this paper is to review the application of artificial intelligence methods (mainly machine learning) to UWS and to investigate the integration of these methods into DSS. The results of the review suggest that artificial neural networks is the most popular method in the water and wastewater sectors followed by clustering. Bayesian networks and swarm intelligence/optimization have shown a spectacular increase in the water sector in the last 10 years, being the latest techniques to be incorporated but overtaking case-based reasoning. Whereas artificial intelligence applications to the water sector focus on modelling, optimization or data mining for knowledge generation, their encapsulation into functional DSS is not fully explored. Few academic applications have made it into decision making practice. We believe that the reason behind this misuse is not related to the methods themselves but rather to the disassociation between the fields of water and computer engineering, the limited practical experience of academics, and the great complexity inherently present. © 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

However, for existing buildings with historically recorded time series energy data, statistical and machine learning techniques have proved to be more accurate and quick. This study presents a comprehensive review of the existing machine learning techniques for forecasting time series energy consumption. Although the emphasis is given to a single time series data analysis, the review is not just limited to it since energy data is often co-analyzed with other time series variables like outdoor weather and indoor environmental conditions. The nine most popular forecasting techniques that are based on the machine learning platform are analyzed.

One such potential substitute to fossil fuels is biodiesel that ensures sustainable energy source. The selection of appropriate source of biodiesel and proper blending of biodiesel plays a major role in alternate energy production. In the present work, a novel hybrid Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) technique was proposed to evaluate and select the optimum fuel biodiesel blend for the IC engine with conflicting criteria to enhance the energy efficiency. Exploratory analysis were carried out on a single cylinder four stroke, air cooled, constant speed, direct injection diesel engine with a rated output of 4.4 kW at 1500 rpm at different loads. Two hybrid MCDM models, namely Fuzzy TOPSIS and Fuzzy VIKOR were proposed. Fuzzy was applied to determine the relative weights of the evaluation criteria whereas TOPSIS and VIKOR were applied to obtain the final ranking of alternatives. Diesel, B20, B40, B60, B80 and B100 fuel blend alternatives are prepared by varying the proportion of biodiesel for MCDM model. Similarly BTE, MRPR, NOx CO2, CO, HC, SMOKE, ID, CD and Exhaust gas temperature were considered as the evaluation criteria. The ranking order by Fuzzy TOPSIS is based on closeness coefficient and Fuzzy VIKOR is based on VIKOR index. In Fuzzy TOPSIS, B40 stands first at 50% and 75% load conditions and second at 25% and full load conditions respectively. In Fuzzy VIKOR, B40 stands first at 25% and 50% conditions and second at no load, 75% and full load conditions respectively. The ranking of alternatives as obtained by both Fuzzy-TOPSIS and Fuzzy-VIKOR is B40 > B20 > Diesel > B80 > B60 > B100 and B40 > B20 > Diesel > B60 > B80 > B100. From the results, it was observed that both the methods indicated that B40 is the best blend to operate the engine. Hence, it is concluded that mixing 40% biodiesel with diesel is suggested as a good partial replacement for diesel.

Though rivers possess self-purifying capacity, water withdrawals for different beneficial uses have impacted it significantly by reducing its flow. Presently, sustainability has also become an important affair of river basin planning and management. Therefore, assessment of behavior of river under sustainability criteria is necessary. However, the uncertainty and complexity associated with the sustainability criteria, randomness of hydrologic variables, decision-makers, and missing data have become a concern for water managers. Such problems can be modeled under fuzzy logic framework. The present work develops a comprehensive artificial intelligence approach, namely ‘MATLAB Fuzzy Inference system’ to determine the self-purifying capacity of the River Ganges. Thirty-three wastewater drains are identified, which discharge untreated wastes along Kanpur–Varanasi stretch of Ganges.

In this paper, we build the case that 5G wireless technology, along with concomitant emerging technologies (such as IoT, big data, artificial intelligence and machine learning), will transform global healthcare systems in the near future. Our optimism around 5G-enabled healthcare stems from a confluence of significant technical pushes that are already at play: apart from the availability of high-throughput low-latency wireless connectivity, other significant factors include the democratization of computing through cloud computing; the democratization of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and cognitive computing (e.g., IBMWatson); and the commoditization of data through crowdsourcing and digital exhaust. These technologies together can finally crack a dysfunctional healthcare system that has largely been impervious to technological innovations. We highlight the persistent deficiencies of the current healthcare system and then demonstrate how the 5G-enabled healthcare revolution can fix these deficiencies. We also highlight open technical research challenges, and potential pitfalls, that may hinder the development of such a 5G-enabled health revolution. © 2017 by the authors.','study object',0,'transformation of healthcare system','means','SDGs',NULL,NULL,'future',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Pakistan',0),('2-s2.0-85038434384','To promote sustainable development, the smart city implies a global vision that merges artificial intelligence, big data, decision making, information and communication technology (ICT), and the internet-of-things (IoT).

Thus, fresh water sources are being gradually diversified to improve the reliability and resilience of the systems. However, as the number of source blending options grows, optimization tools are needed to design drinking water supply systems that comply with indicators of cost, resilience, and water quality. This paper proposes a pioneering methodological approach, based on an ant-colony-optimization (ACO) algorithm, to optimize the blending of drinking water from different sources to minimize operational costs of a given system originating from a number of impaired water sources while complying with water quality standards. To evidence the potential of the ACO algorithm to solve such a system, a virtual case study was designed that considers eight fresh water sources, including seawater desalination and potable reuse. Seven scenarios were developed with different weightings to service outage, water conveyance and treatment costs while complying with water quality goals in regard to total organic carbon, nitrates, and total dissolved solids. It was shown that the cost per volumetric unit of water can vary considerably depending on the weightings of the three cost items. This paper provides a rigorous scientific approach to propose a methodology supporting the decision-making process of selecting a mixture of different sources to achieve the overall lowest system cost. Hence, this work contributes to improving the resilience and sustainability of urban water supplies. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'optimize the blending of drinking water from different sources to minimize operational costs of a given system','means',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','quantitative',NULL,'virtual case study dataset that considers eight fresh water sources','Spain',0),('2-s2.0-85039849398','Modeling individual trees in tropical rain forests in the Amazon allows for the safe use of scarce resources in a sustainable way. Unfortunately, in the Brazilian Amazon, rain forest growth and production models are not yet used to estimate future forest stock. Thus, forest management plans do not present technical-scientific support that guarantees sustainable production of wood throughout the cutting cycle. Therefore, this work aims to estimate the survival and mortality of individual trees in a selectively harvested forest using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to support silvicultural decisions in forest management in the Amazon rain forest. In 1979, a selective harvest was carried out, with 72.5 m3 ha-1 in an area of 64 ha in Floresta Nacional do Tapajós, in the state of Pará Brazil. In 1981, 36 permanent plots were installed at random and inventoried. Nine successive measurements were carried from 1982 to 2012. In the modeling, classification, survival, and mortality, training and ANN testing were performed, using input variables such as: different semi-distance-independent competition indices (DSICI), diameter measured (dbh), forest class (FC), trunk identification class (TIC), competition index (CI), growth groups (GG), liana infestation intensity (liana); and crown lighting (CL); Damage to tree (D) and tree rotting (R). The categorical output variables (Classification) were Dead or Surviving tree. Overall efficiency of the classification was above 89% in training and above 90% in the test for all ANNs. Survival classification hit rate was above 99% in the test and training for all ANNs but the mortality score was low, with hit rates below 6%. The overall Kappa coefficient was below 8% for all ANNs (ranked “poor”) but all ANNs were above 55% in the survival classification (ranked “good”). ANN estimates the individual survival of trees more accurately but this does not occur with mortality, which is a rarer event than survival. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'mortality and survival of individual trees after harvesting wood using artificial neural networks in the amazon rain forest','means','sustainable ressource use','local','snapshot','present; future','quantitative','Brazil','field data','Brazil',0),('2-s2.0-85040945850','Introduction: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), over 130 million people are in constant need of humanitarian assistance due to natural disasters, disease outbreaks, and conflicts, among other factors. These health crises can compromise the resilience of healthcare systems, which are essential for achieving the health objectives of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) of the United Nations (UN). During a humanitarian health crisis, rapid and informed decision making is required. This is often challenging due to information scarcity, limited resources, and strict time constraints. Moreover, the traditional approach to digital health development, which involves a substantial requirement analysis, a feasibility study, and deployment of technology, is ill-suited for many crisis contexts. The emergence of Web 2.0 technologies and social media platforms in the past decade, such as Twitter, has created a new paradigm of massive information and misinformation, in which new technologies need to be developed to aid rapid decision making during humanitarian health crises. Objective: Humanitarian health crises increasingly require the analysis of massive amounts of information produced by different sources, such as social media content, and, hence, they are a prime case for the use of artificial intelligence (AI) techniques to help identify relevant information and make it actionable. To identify challenges and opportunities for using AI in humanitarian health crises, we reviewed the literature on the use of AI techniques to process social media. Methodology: We performed a narrative literature review aimed at identifying examples of the use of AI in humanitarian health crises. Our search strategy was designed to get a broad overview of the different applications of AI in a humanitarian health crisis and their challenges. A total of 1459 articles were screened, and 24 articles were included in the final analysis. Results: Successful case studies of AI applications in a humanitarian health crisis have been reported, such as for outbreak detection. A commonly shared concern in the reviewed literature is the technical challenge of analyzing large amounts of data in real time. Data interoperability, which is essential to data sharing, is also a barrier with regard to the integration of online and traditional data sources. Human and organizational aspects that might be key factors for the adoption of AI and social media remain understudied. There is also a publication bias toward high-income countries, as we identified few examples in low-income countries. Further, we did not identify any examples of certain types of major crisis, such armed conflicts, in which misinformation might be more common. Conclusions: The feasibility of using AI to extract valuable information during a humanitarian health crisis is proven in many cases. There is a lack of research on how to integrate the use of AI into the work-flow and large-scale deployments of humanitarian aid during a health crisis. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.','study object',0,'AI in humanitarian health crises','means','SDGs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Qatar',0),('2-s2.0-85041708171','Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) is an innovative method in modern education, especially important for autonomous study and the sharing of global excellent education resources. However, it is not easy to implement the teaching process according to the specific characters of students by MOOCs because the number of participants is huge and the teacher cannot identify the characters of students through a face to face interaction. As a new subject combined with different areas, such as economics, sociology, environment, and even engineering, the education of sustainability-related courses requires elaborate consideration of individualized teaching for students from diverse backgrounds and with different learning styles. Although the major MOOC platforms or learning management systems (LMSs) have tried lots of efforts in the design of course system and the contents of the courses for sustainability education, the achievements are still unsatisfied, at least the issue of how to effectively take into account the individual characteristics of participants remains unsolved. A hybrid Neural Network (NN) model is proposed in this paper which integrates a Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) based Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) in an effort to detect individual learning style dynamically. The model was trained by learners\' behavior data and applied to predicting their learning styles. With identified learning style for each learner, the power of MOOC platform can be greatly enhanced by being able to offer the capabilities of recommending specific learning path and the relevant contents individually according to their characters. The efficiency of learning can thus be significantly improved. The proposed model was applied to the online study of sustainability-related course based on a MOOC platform with more than 9,400,000 learners. The results revealed that the learners could effectively increase their learning efficiency and quality for the courses when the learning styles are identified, and proper recommendations are made by using our method. © 2018 by the authors.

The construction and rehabilitation industry is concerned with the maintenance of monuments and reducing the economic costs of urgent interventions by taking preventive conservation action in historic cities. By applying a vulnerability index or analyzing the service life of buildings, it is possible to reduce risk and optimize the identification, evaluation and prioritization of urgent monument restoration tasks in a city or a region to establish preventive conservation policies. Design/methodology/approach: This research sets out the concepts of vulnerability and service life, focusing on their methodologies in comparison with other techniques for building diagnosis, discussing the differences between indexes that measure the vulnerability and service life of buildings. Findings: The vulnerability of three churches in Seville (Spain) was studied by means of their vulnerability index, based on Delphi analysis, and the service life of these buildings was also assessed, based on artificial intelligence tools. Delphi and artificial intelligence tools allow us to compare and dovetail different scenarios and expert opinions. The degree of each monument’s conservation is defined as its vulnerability index, which is an indirect function of deterioration levels. The service life of buildings, on the other hand, includes the assessment of vulnerability and hazards. Practical implications: This study is useful for stakeholders, including small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and policymakers, as an important reference on diagnosis, including updated, inexpensive and sustainable methodologies to manage the conservation of monuments, which are easy to implement in developed and developing countries. The application of vulnerability and/or service life indicators is crucial to ensuring the sustainability and improvement of maintenance carried out on cultural heritage buildings.

Accurate forecasts of annual energy demand are essential to schedule energy supply and provide valuable suggestions for developing related industries. In the existing literature on energy use prediction, the artificial intelligence-based (AI-based) model has received considerable attention. However, few econometric and statistical evidences exist that can prove the reliability of the current AI-based model, an area that still needs to be addressed. In this study, a new energy demand forecasting framework is presented at first. On the basis of historical annual data of electricity usage over the period of 1985-2015, the coefficients of linear and quadratic forms of the AI-based model are optimized by combining an adaptive genetic algorithm and a cointegration analysis shown as an example. Prediction results of the proposed model indicate that the annual growth rate of electricity demand in China will slow down. However, China will continue to demand about 13 trillion kilowatt hours in 2030 because of population growth, economic growth, and urbanization.

Despite global advancement, the problems associated sustainability have not been sufficiently addressed, due to mismanaged governance, poorly implemented policies, lack of suitable data and over-exploitation of river resources. Therefore, major rivers basins across the globe need an integrative and comprehensive strategic approach considering the diverse stakeholder\'s perspective and conflicting criteria pertaining to sustainable management. The present study develops a decision support framework to assess the sustainability by coupling an improved fuzzy based hybridized strength-weakness-opportunities and threats model (FH-SWOT) with a geostatistical approach. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the model Ganges river basin, India has been taken as a case study. The novelty of the study is to devise six different hybrid mechanisms under FH-SWOT framework to reach best possible strategic alternatives along with nominal, optimistic and pessimistic perspectives of the stakeholders. To enhance the model\'s productivity, it is coupled with weighted overlay geo-statistical approach to identify/prioritize the most vulnerable/critical locations, which needs suitable implementation of strategic alternatives derived using FH-SWOT model. The FH-SWOT model developed herein simultaneously delineates strategic alternatives and corresponding priority zones, while addressing the uncertainties related to stakeholder\'s conflicts and imprecise data to reach optimal, pessimistic and nominal viewpoints, which leads to development of an innovative and comprehensive decision-support framework for assessing sustainability. The key policies derived from the study involve enforcing regulations on disposal of heavy metals, developing hydropower, adaptation of organic farming, education and participation of stakeholders, regulations on dams and barrages with a score of 0.2453, 0.2205, 0.2088, 0.1898, and 0.1288 respectively. Also, Kanpur- Varanasi stretch has been delineated as very high priority zone followed by regions located along the banks of Ganges.

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) annually claims more lives and costs more dollars than any other disease globally amid widening health disparities, despite the known significant reductions in this burden by low cost dietary changes. The world\'s first medical school-based teaching kitchen therefore launched CHOP-Medical Students as the largest known multisite cohort study of hands-on cooking and nutrition education versus traditional curriculum for medical students. Methods. This analysis provides a novel integration of artificial intelligence-based machine learning (ML) with causal inference statistics. 43 ML automated algorithms were tested, with the top performer compared to triply robust propensity score-adjusted multilevel mixed effects regression panel analysis of longitudinal data. Inverse-variance weighted fixed effects meta-analysis pooled the individual estimates for competencies. Results. 3,248 unique medical trainees met study criteria from 20 medical schools nationally from August 1, 2012, to June 26, 2017, generating 4,026 completed validated surveys. ML analysis produced similar results to the causal inference statistics based on root mean squared error and accuracy. Hands-on cooking and nutrition education compared to traditional medical school curriculum significantly improved student competencies (OR 2.14, 95% CI 2.00-2.28, p<0.001) and MedDiet adherence (OR 1.40, 95% CI 1.07-1.84, p=0.015), while reducing trainees\' soft drink consumption (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.37-0.85, p=0.007). Overall improved competencies were demonstrated from the initial study site through the scale-up of the intervention to 10 sites nationally (p<0.001). Discussion. This study provides the first machine learning-augmented causal inference analysis of a multisite cohort showing hands-on cooking and nutrition education for medical trainees improves their competencies counseling patients on nutrition, while improving students\' own diets.

The aim of the current study is to propose and verify new artificial intelligence methods for the spatial prediction of groundwater spring potential mapping at the Koohdasht-Nourabad plain, Lorestan province, Iran. These methods are new hybrids of an adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) and five metaheuristic algorithms, namely invasive weed optimization (IWO), differential evolution (DE), firefly algorithm (FA), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and the bees algorithm (BA). A total of 2463 spring locations were identified and collected, and then divided randomly into two subsets: 70% (1725 locations) were used for training models and the remaining 30% (738 spring locations) were utilized for evaluating the models. A total of 13 groundwater conditioning factors were prepared for modeling, namely the slope degree, slope aspect, altitude, plan curvature, stream power index (SPI), topographic wetness index (TWI), terrain roughness index (TRI), distance from fault, distance from river, land use/land cover, rainfall, soil order, and lithology. In the next step, the step-wise assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) method was applied to quantify the degree of relevance of these groundwater conditioning factors. The global performance of these derived models was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). In addition, the Friedman and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were carried out to check and confirm the best model to use in this study. The result showed that all models have a high prediction performance; however, the ANFIS-DE model has the highest prediction capability (AUC Combining double low line 0.875), followed by the ANFIS-IWO model, the ANFIS-FA model (0.873), the ANFIS-PSO model (0.865), and the ANFIS-BA model (0.839).

Lately, and in order to contribute to the earth sustainability, a new concept emerged named Green software which is computer software that can be developed and used efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact to the environment. Currently, new teaching methods based on students\' learning process are being developed in the European Higher Education Area. Most of them are oriented to promote students\' interest in the course\'s contents and offer personalized feedback. Online judging is a promising method for encouraging students\' participation in the e-learning process, although it still has to be researched and developed to be widely used and in a more efficient way. The great amount of data available in an online judging tool provides the possibility of exploring some of the most indicative attributes (e.g., running time, memory) for learning programming concepts, techniques and languages. So far, the most applied methods for automatically gathering information from the judging systems are based on statistical methods and, although providing reasonable correlations, these methods have not been proven to provide enough information for predicting grades when dealing with a huge amount of data. Therefore, the great novelty of this paper is to develop a data mining approach to predict program correctness as well as the grades of the students\' practices. For this purpose, powerful data mining technologies taken from the artificial intelligence domain have been used. In particular, in this study, we have used logistic regression, decision trees, artificial neural network and support vector machines; which have been properly identified as the most suitable ones for predicting activities in the e-learning domains. The results have achieved an accuracy of around 74%, both in the prediction of the program correctness as well as in the practice grades\' prediction. Another relevant issue provided in this paper is a comparison among these four techniques to obtain the best accuracy in predicting grades based on the availability of data as well as their taxonomy. The Decision Trees classifier has obtained the best confusion matrix, and time and memory efficiency were identified as the most important predictor variables. In view of these results, we can conclude that the development of green software leads programmers to implement correct software. © 2018 by the authors.','method',0,'Impact Factors on the Correctness of Software','means','and in order to contribute to the earth sustainability, a new concept emerged named Green software which is computer software that can be developed and used efficiently and effectively with minimal or no impact to the environment.

Nowadays, improving streamflow predictions based on uneven precipitation is an important task. The main purpose of this study is to integrate the ensemble technique concept into artificial neural networks for reducing model uncertainty in hourly streamflow predictions. The ensemble streamflow predictions are built following two steps: (1) Generating the ensemble members through disturbance of initial weights, data resampling, and alteration of model structure; (2) consolidating the model outputs through the arithmetic average, stacking, and Bayesian model average. This study investigates various ensemble strategies on two study sites, where the watershed size and hydrological conditions are different. The results help to realize whether the ensemble methods are sensitive to hydrological or physiographical conditions. Additionally, the applicability and availability of the ensemble strategies can be easily evaluated in this study. Among various ensemble strategies, the best ESP is produced by the combination of boosting (data resampling) and Bayesian model average. The results demonstrate that the ensemble neural networks greatly improved the accuracy of streamflow predictions as compared to a single neural network, and the improvement made by the ensemble neural network is about 19-37% and 20-30% in Longquan Creek and Jinhua River watersheds, respectively, for 1-3 h ahead streamflow prediction. Moreover, the results obtained from different ensemble strategies are quite consistent in both watersheds, indicating that the ensemble strategies are insensitive to hydrological and physiographical factors.

In this research, a novel hybrid intelligence approach based on evolutionary fuzzy (EF) approach is developed to predict river suspended sediment concentration. To demonstrate the modeling application, one of the highly affected rivers located in the north-western part of California is selected as a case study (i.e., Eel River). Eel River is considered as one of the most polluted river due to the streamside land sliding, owing to the highly stochastic water river discharge. Thus, the predictive model is constructed using discharge information as it is the main trigger for the SSC amount. The prediction conducted on different locations of the stream (i.e., up-stream and down-stream stations). Three different well-established integrative fuzzy models are developed for the validation purpose including adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system coupled with subtractive clustering (ANFIS-SC), grid partition (ANFIS-GP), and fuzzy c-means (ANFIS-FCM) models. The predictive models evaluated based on several numerical indicators and two-dimension graphical diagram (i.e., Taylor diagram) that vividly exhibits the observed and predicted values. The attained results evidenced the predictability of the EF model for the SSC over the other models. The discharge information provided an excellent input attributes for the predictive models. In summary, the discovered model showed an outstanding data-intelligence model for the environmental perspective and particularly for Eel River.

By employing the findings in context of smart cities research, the paper then adds to the debate on energy sustainability in urban space. Existing research tends to be limited by data granularity (not in high frequency) and consideration of about six kinds of appliances. In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm support vector machine multiple kernel learning approach (GA-SVM-MKL) is proposed for NILM, with consideration of 20 kinds of appliance. Genetic algorithm helps to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and design the optimal kernel function based on various kernel properties. The performance indicators are sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp) and overall accuracy (OA) of the classifier. First, the performance evaluation of proposed GA-SVM-MKL achieves Se of 92.1%, Sp of 91.5% and OA of 91.8%. Second, the percentage improvement of performance indicators using proposed method is more than 21% compared with traditional kernel. Third, results reveal that by keeping different modes of electric appliance as identical class label, the performance indicators can increase to about 15%. Forth, tunable modes of GA-SVM-MKL classifier are proposed to further enhance the performance indicators up to 7%. Overall, this paper is a bold and novel contribution to the debate on energy utilization and sustainability in urban spaces as it integrates insights from artificial intelligence, IoT, and big data analytics and queries them in a context defined by energy sustainability in smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

Due to the variability of each household’s personalized activity, difficulties exist for traditional methods, such as auto-regressive moving average models, machine learning methods and non-deep neural networks, to provide accurate prediction for single household electric power consumption. Recent works show that the long short term memory (LSTM) neural network outperforms most of those traditional methods for power consumption forecasting problems. Nevertheless, two research gaps remain as unsolved problems in the literature. First, the prediction accuracy is still not reaching the practical level for real-world industrial applications. Second, most existing works only work on the one-step forecasting problem; the forecasting time is too short for practical usage. In this study, a hybrid deep learning neural network framework that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) with LSTM is proposed to further improve the prediction accuracy. The original short-term forecasting strategy is extended to a multi-step forecasting strategy to introduce more response time for electricity market bidding. Five real-world household power consumption datasets are studied, the proposed hybrid deep learning neural network outperforms most of the existing approaches, including auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, persistent model, support vector regression (SVR) and LSTM alone.

The large scale and importance of water projects, the investments needed, the difficulty in predicting the results, and the irreversible character of the decisions have made decision making a complex scientific process. This paper presents a multicriteria analysis (MCA) tool for evaluating water resource management (WRM) strategies and selecting the most appropriate among them, using as an example a Greek area based on agricultural economy, which faces water scarcity problems. Seven alternative strategies were evaluated under hydrological and economic criteria. Four techniques were used-multi attribute utility theory (MAUT), analytic hierarchy process (AHP), elimination and choice expressing reality (ELECTRE), and technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS)-based on the main MCA techniques (utility theory, analytical hierarchy, outranking theory, and classification theory, respectively), to compare their performance, and to reach the most appropriate and \'fitting\' method for the examined problem. The weightings extracted from two samples, (i) a sample of decision makers/stakeholders and (ii) a group of WRM experts, were used to compare the results. The process was carried out for each questionnaire, and thus the model shows the uncertainty of each sample group and of each method, as well as the overall uncertainty. The results illustrate the reality of the WRM problems of the watershed, enlighten their roots, and have further strengthened our conviction that the cooperation between the scientific community and the authorities is vital for more sustainable and efficient WRM. © 2018 by the authors.','method',0,'tool for evaluating water resource management (WRM) strategies','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','Greece',NULL,'Greece',0),('2-s2.0-85058172417','Ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all, at all ages, is one main objective for sustainable development proposed by the United Nations.

Population increase and water cycle intensification are extending not only globally but also among Pakistan\'s water resources. The frequency of floods has increased in the last few decades in the country, which emphasizes the importance of efficient practices needed to adopt for various aspects of water resource management such as reservoir scheduling, water sustainability, and water supply. The purpose of this study is to develop a novel hybrid model for streamflow forecasting and validate its efficiency at the upper Indus basin (UIB), Pakistan. Maximum streamflow in the River Indus from its upper mountain basin results from melting snow or glaciers and climatic unevenness of both precipitation and temperature inputs, which will, therefore, affect rural livelihoods at both a local and a regional scale through effects on runoff in the Upper Indus basin (UIB). This indicates that basins receive the bulk of snowfall input to sustain the glacier system. The present study will help find the runoff from high altitude catchments and estimated flood occurrence for the proposed and constructed hydropower projects of the Upper Indus basin (UIB). Due to climate variability, the upper Indus basin (UIB) was further divided into three zone named as sub-zones, zone one (z1), zone two (z2), and zone three (z3). The hybrid models are designed by incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) models, which includes Feedforward backpropagation (FFBP) and Radial basis function (RBF) with decomposition methods. This includes a discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). On the basis of the autocorrelation function and the cross-correlation function of streamflow, precipitation and temperature inputs are selected for all developed models. Data have been analyzed by comparing the simulation outputs of the models with a correlation coefficient (R), root mean square errors (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean absolute errors (MAE). The proposed hybrid models have been applied to monthly streamflow observations from three hydrological stations and 17 meteorological stations in the UIB. The results show that the prediction accuracy of the decomposition-based models is usually better than those of AI-based models. Among the DWT and EEMD based hybrid model, EEMD has performed significantly well when compared to all other hybrid and individual AI models. The peak value analysis is also performed to confirm the results\' precision rate during the flood season (May-October). The detailed comparative analysis showed that the RBFNN integrated with EEMD has better forecasting capabilities as compared to other developed models and EEMD-RBF can capture the nonlinear characteristics of the streamflow time series during the flood season with more precision. © 2018 by the authors.','study object',0,'Predistion of streamflow','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','future','quantitative','Pakistan','The dataset used in the study consists of streamflow data collected from Pakistan Surface-water Hydrology Project (SWHP), Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA), and Pakistan Meteorological Department (PMD) for the period ranging from 1960 to 2012, 1969–2012, and 1972–2012 for the different zones of the Upper Indus Basin (z1, z2, z3)','China',0),('2-s2.0-85059813402','Within the context of the Smart City, the need for intelligent approaches to manage and coordinate the diverse range of supply and conversion technologies and demand applications has been well established.

To ensure the treatment quality of sewage, the wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) often over-aerate the air and over-add the chemicals. This results in a waste of energy consumption and increases the operation cost for WWTP. With the rapid expansion of industrialization and urbanization, the quantity of municipal sewage has increased by years. Energy saving and sustainable water management for municipal WWTP are becoming an urgent issue that needs to be solved. This paper proposes a COD load forecasting model for municipal WWTP using hybrid artificial intelligence algorithms. The auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) algorithm is used for sewage inflow forecasting, and the vector auto-regression (VAR) algorithm is used for COD forecasting. The real-time data from a municipal WWTP is collected for model verification. Besides the proposed ARMA + VAR model, the BPNN, LSSVM, and GA-BPNN based COD load forecasting models are also studied as the contrasting cases.

The prediction of leachate amounts is elementary in sustainable waste management and leachate treatment processes, before discharging to surrounding environment. In developing countries, the accurate evaluation of leachate generation rates has often considered a challenge due to the lack of reliable data and high measurement costs. Leachate generation is related to several factors, including meteorological data, waste generation rates, and landfill design conditions. The high variations in these factors lead to complicating leachate modeling processes. This study aims at identifying the key elements contributing to leachate production and developing various AI-based models to predict leachate generation rates. These models included Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-Multi-linear perceptron (MLP) with single and double hidden layers, and support vector machine (SVM) regression time series algorithms. Various performance measures were applied to evaluate the developed model’s accuracy. In this study, input optimization process showed that three inputs were acceptable for modeling the leachate generation rates, namely dumped waste quantity, rainfall level, and emanated gases. The initial performance analysis showed that ANN-MLP2 model—which applies two hidden layers—achieved the best performance, then followed by ANN-MLP1 model—which applies one hidden layer and three inputs—while SVM model gave the lowest performance. Ranges and frequency of relative error (RE%) also demonstrate that ANN-MLP models outperformed SVM models. Furthermore, low and peak flow criterion (LFC and PFC) assessment of leachate inflow values in ANN-MLP model with two hidden layers made more accurate values than other models. Since minimizing data collection and processing efforts as well as minimizing modeling complexity are critical in the hydrological modeling process, the applied input optimization process and the developed models in this study were able to provide a good performance in the modeling of leachate generation efficiently. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.','study object',0,'predicting monthly leachate generation rates for a landfill site in Malaysia','means',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Malaysia','dataset used in the study involves three key inputs for modeling the leachate generation rates, which are the dumped waste quantity, rainfall level, and emanated gases','Malaysia',0),('2-s2.0-85061537056','Increasing sustainability demands initiate estimating various design and control opportunities for classifying energy-efficient plan ever more significant.

Reducing the impacts of agrochemicals on the environment and human health is instrumental for agricultural sustainability and cleaner production. To date, limited studies have focused on the issues of rice intensification, realistic agrochemical-saving targets, human health concerns associated with agrochemical use, and protective measures that may help to reduce occupational exposure during pesticide application. Cross-sectional data of 360 rice growers were collected from September to October 2017 from 9 districts of Punjab, Pakistan using multistage sampling technique. A combination of descriptive statistics and econometric methods was used in this study. The results found a 60% rice efficiency, which is evidence that farm resources were not utilized at the optimal level. An artificial neural network method (ANN) was suggested to reduce the quantity of pesticides and pure N by 45.2 and 37.2%, respectively, at a given level of rice yield. However, pure P, pure K, zinc, and farm yard manure (FYM) were recommended to increase by 490.9, 18.4, 64.7, and 32.6%, respectively than existing level. The results of the Cobb-Douglas (CD) production function found positive significant impacts of pure P, pure K, zinc, and FYM on the rice yield. According to a Tobit regression model, the rice efficiency significantly increased with education and farming experience, while it decreased with increasing crop area under rice cultivation and the distance among rice plots. Pesticide application caused skin irritation, eye irritation, cough, dizziness, nausea, and diarrhoea in 33, 41.7, 38, 30.5, 27.5, and 12% of the population, respectively. A few cases of death (3%) and serious illness (10%) due to drinking pesticides intentionally or unintentionally were also discovered. A Poisson regression model confirmed that pesticide poisoning significantly increased the incidence of eye irritation, skin irritation, dizziness, cough, and nausea during pesticide application. Moreover, cases of occupational health exposure were significantly higher among those who did not adopt protective measures. A negative binomial regression suggested that the use of protective measures, such as protective clothes, goggles, mask, gloves and boots, during chemical application significantly reduced the risk to human health. A lack of education and awareness about the appropriate and safe use of agrochemicals are the main reasons for the overutilization of pesticides and for the negative consequences on human health. This study stresses the importance of using agrochemicals at the recommended level and instead using bio-chemicals for agricultural sustainability and to protect human health. Moreover, the use of pesticide protective measures is highly recommended to avoid respiratory and dermal exposure to pesticides. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd','method',0,'estimation of target values of agrochemicals','means','buzzword','regional','snapshot','past','quantitative','Paktistan','interview; hard sensor data','China',1),('2-s2.0-85062843586','Drought is a popular scientific issue in global climate change research. Accurate monitoring of drought has important implications for the sustainable development of regional agriculture in the context of increasingly complex global climate change. Deep learning is a widely used technique in the field of artificial intelligence. However, ongoing on drought monitoring using deep learning is relatively scarce. In this paper, the various hazard factors in drought development were comprehensively considered based on satellite data including Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) as multi-source remote sensing data. By using the deep learning technique, a comprehensive drought monitoring model was constructed and tested in Henan Province of China as an example. The results showed that the comprehensive drought model has good applicability in the monitoring of meteorological drought and agricultural drought. There was a significant positive correlation between the drought indicators of the model output and the comprehensive meteorological drought index (CI) measured at the site scale. The consistency rate of the drought grade of the two models was 85.6% and 79.8% for the training set and the test set, respectively. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the standard precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) was between 0.772 and 0.910 (P < 0.01), which indicated a strong level of significance. The correlation coefficient between the drought index of the model and the soil relative moisture at a 10 cm depth was greater than 0.550 (P < 0.01), and there was a good correlation between them.

The PN was applied to the formulation of remanufacturing process, while the A* algorithm generated and searched for an optimal or near optimal feasible schedule through the reachability graph (RG). We took the high value-added cylinder block of engine as a research object to minimize the makespan of reprocessing a batch used components. This scheduling problem involved in batch and parallel processing machines, and the uncertain processing time and routes will complicate the scheduling problem. Three heuristics were designed to guide the search process through the RG in PN. To avoid state space explosion and select promising nodes, a new rule-based dynamic window was developed to improve the efficiency of the algorithm, and this rule was examined to outperform the conventional one. Under the determined scheduling strategy, the dynamic behavior of energy consumption rate during the processing time was simulated using PN tool, which would assist remanufacturers to develop potential strategies for energy efficiency improvement.

In addition, with ever increasing tolerance of pest, diseases and weeds there is growing pressure on traditional crop genetic and protective chemistry technologies of the ‘Green Revolution’. To ease the burden of these challenges, there has been a move to automate and robotise aspects of the farming process. This drive has focussed typically on higher value sectors, such as horticulture and viticulture, that have relied on seasonal manual labour to maintain produce supply. In developed economies, and increasingly developing nations, pressure on labour supply has become unsustainable and forced the need for greater mechanisation and higher labour productivity. This paper creates the case that for broadacre crops, such as cereals, a wholly new approach is necessary, requiring the establishment of an integrated biology & physical engineering infrastructure, which can work in harmony with current breeding, chemistry and agronomic solutions. For broadacre crops the driving pressure is to sustainably intensify production; increase yields and/or productivity whilst reducing environmental impact. Additionally, our limited understanding of the complex interactions between the variations in pests, weeds, pathogens, soils, water, environment and crops is inhibiting growth in resource productivity and creating yield gaps.

The present research is focused on defining a formal representation that details the most relevant concepts associated with the creation and adoption of innovative medical technology in the Spanish healthcare system. Methods: The methodology applied is based on the methontology process, including peer-review identification and selection of concepts from the ITEMAS innovation indicators and innovation management system standards. This stage was followed by an iterative validation process. Concepts were then conceptualised, formalised and implemented in an ontology. Results: The ontology defined describes how relationships between employees, organisations, projects and ideas can be applied to generate results that are transferrable to the market, general public and scientific forums. Overall, we identified 136 concepts, 138 object properties and 30 properties in a five-level hierarchy. The ontology was tested and validated as an appropriate framework for calculating the ITEMAS innovation indicators. Conclusions: The consensus concepts were expressed in the form of an ontology to be used as a single communication format between the members of the ITEMAS network. Healthcare centres can compare their innovation results and obtain a better understanding of their innovation context based on the reasoning techniques of artificial intelligence. As a result, they can benefit from advanced analytical capabilities to define the most appropriate innovation policies for each centre based on the common experience of the large number of healthcare centres involved. The results can be used to create a map of agents and knowledge to show capabilities, projects and services provided by each of the participating centres.

In Smart Factories intelligent robots, tools, and smart workpieces communicate and collaborate with each other continuously, which results in self-organizing and self-optimizing production. The significance of Smart Factories is to make production more competitive, efficient, flexible and sustainable. The purpose of the study is not only the introduction of the concept and operation of the Smart Factories, but at the same time to show the application of Simulation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods in practice. The significance of the study is that the economic and social operational requirements and impacts of Smart Factories are summarized and the characteristics of the traditional factory and the Smart Factory are compared. The most significant added value of the research is that a real case study is introduced for Simulation of the operation of two collaborating robots applying AI. Quantitative research methods are used, such as numerical and graphical modeling and Simulation, 3D design, furthermore executing Tabu Search in the space of trajectories, but in some aspects the work included fundamental methods, like suggesting an original whip-lashing analog for designing robot trajectories. The conclusion of the case study is that-due to using Simulation and AI methods-the motion path of the robot arm is improved, resulting in more than five percent time-savings, which leads to a significant improvement in productivity.

Objective: In this paper, we have focused on machine learning (ML) as a form of AI and have provided a framework for thinking about use cases of ML in health care. We have structured our discussion of challenges in the implementation of ML in comparison with other technologies using the framework of Nonadoption, Abandonment, and Challenges to the Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability of Health and Care Technologies (NASSS). Methods: After providing an overview of AI technology, we describe use cases of ML as falling into the categories of decision support and automation. We suggest these use cases apply to clinical, operational, and epidemiological tasks and that the primary function of ML in health care in the near term will be decision support. We then outline unique implementation issues posed by ML initiatives in the categories addressed by the NASSS framework, specifically including meaningful decision support, explainability, privacy, consent, algorithmic bias, security, scalability, the role of corporations, and the changing nature of health care work. Results: Ultimately, we suggest that the future of ML in health care remains positive but uncertain, as support from patients, the public, and a wide range of health care stakeholders is necessary to enable its meaningful implementation. Conclusions: If the implementation science community is to facilitate the adoption of ML in ways that stand to generate widespread benefits, the issues raised in this paper will require substantial attention in the coming years. © 2019 Linda Tizek, Maximilian Schielein, Melvin Ruth, Sonja Stander, Manuel Pedro Pereira, Bernadette Eberlein, Tilo Biedermann, Alexander Zink.

Therefore, we evaluated the accuracy of an artificial intelligence (AI) model using deep learning in a population-based diabetic retinopathy screening programme in Zambia, a lower-middle-income country. Methods: We adopted an ensemble AI model consisting of a combination of two convolutional neural networks (an adapted VGGNet architecture and a residual neural network architecture) for classifying retinal colour fundus images. We trained our model on 76 370 retinal fundus images from 13 099 patients with diabetes who had participated in the Singapore Integrated Diabetic Retinopathy Program, between 2010 and 2013, which has been published previously. In this clinical validation study, we included all patients with a diagnosis of diabetes that attended a mobile screening unit in five urban centres in the Copperbelt province of Zambia from Feb 1 to June 31, 2012. In our model, referable diabetic retinopathy was defined as moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy or worse, diabetic macular oedema, and ungradable images. Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy comprised severe non-proliferative and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We calculated the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity for referable diabetic retinopathy, and sensitivities of vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular oedema compared with the grading by retinal specialists. We did a multivariate analysis for systemic risk factors and referable diabetic retinopathy between AI and human graders. Findings: A total of 4504 retinal fundus images from 3093 eyes of 1574 Zambians with diabetes were prospectively recruited. Referable diabetic retinopathy was found in 697 (22·5%) eyes, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy in 171 (5·5%) eyes, and diabetic macular oedema in 249 (8·1%) eyes. The AUC of the AI system for referable diabetic retinopathy was 0·973 (95% CI 0·969–0·978), with corresponding sensitivity of 92·25% (90·10–94·12) and specificity of 89·04% (87·85–90·28). Vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy sensitivity was 99·42% (99·15–99·68) and diabetic macular oedema sensitivity was 97·19% (96·61–97·77). The AI model and human graders showed similar outcomes in referable diabetic retinopathy prevalence detection and systemic risk factors associations. Both the AI model and human graders identified longer duration of diabetes, higher level of glycated haemoglobin, and increased systolic blood pressure as risk factors associated with referable diabetic retinopathy. Interpretation: An AI system shows clinically acceptable performance in detecting referable diabetic retinopathy, vision-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular oedema in population-based diabetic retinopathy screening. This shows the potential application and adoption of such AI technology in an under-resourced African population to reduce the incidence of preventable blindness, even when the model is trained in a different population.

To meet this challenge, it is necessary to make major improvements on current food production and distribution systems capabilities, as well as to adapt these systems to expected trends such as climate change. Changing climate patterns may present opportunities for unidentified, geographical regions with adequate climate patterns to produce high-value agricultural products in a profitable and sustainable manner. This paper focuses on the design and planning aspects of a discovery process to unearth agri-food supply chains capable of generating attractive return on investments. A stochastic optimization framework is used to develop planting and harvesting schedules for a set of identified regions with complementary weather characteristics. To address the high-level of variability in the problem context, a two-stage stochastic decomposition method is used to consider a larger number of scenarios. As part of the solution process, a modeling scheme is developed that learns past interactions between entering discretized, weather scenarios and optimal first-stage solutions. In this context, machine learning and dimensionality reduction techniques are used to iteratively estimate each region\'s probability of belonging to first-stage solutions based on previous solution-scenario results. The implementation of the stochastic framework is shown through a case study applied to multiple locations within the US southwest states of Arizona and New Mexico. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'Discovery of complementary agricultural systems','means','buzzword','regional','snapshot','past; present','quantitative','United States of America','Historical daily maximum, minimum, and precipitation datasets were collected from 1987 to 2016 for all available weather stations across the two states available from NOAA','United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85070968799','Over the past forty years, income growth for the middle and lower classes has stagnated, while the economy (and with it, economic inequality) has grown significantly. Early automation, the decline of labor unions, changes in corporate taxation, the financialization and globalization of the economy, deindustrialization in the U.S. and many OECD countries, and trade have contributed to these trends. However, the transformative roles of more recent automation and digital technologies/artificial intelligence (AI) are now considered by many as additional and potentially more potent forces undermining the ability of workers to maintain their foothold in the economy. These drivers of change are intensifying the extent to which advancing technology imbedded in increasingly productive real capital is driving productivity. To compound the problem, many solutions presented by industrialized nations to environmental problems rely on hyper-efficient technologies, which if fully implemented, could further advance the displacement of well-paid job opportunities for many. While there are numerous ways to address economic inequality, there is growing interest in using some form of universal basic income (UBI) to enhance income and provide economic stability. However, these approaches rarely consider the potential environmental impact from the likely increase in aggregate demand for goods and services or consider ways to focus this demand on more sustainable forms of consumption. Based on the premise that the problems of income distribution and environmental sustainability must be addressed in an integrated and holistic way, this paper considers how a range of approaches to financing a UBI system, and a complementary market solution based on an ownership-broadening approach to inclusive capitalism, might advance or undermine strategies to improve environmental sustainability. © 2019 by the authors.','study object',0,'Universal Basic income','means','triple planetary crisis; planetary boundaries; SDGs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85071002780','We inspect the relevant literature on sustainable manufacturing in Industry 4.0, providing both quantitative evidence on trends and numerous in-depth empirical examples.

The applications of AI to sustainable architecture include energy-efficient building design, forecasting and minimizing energy consumption, strategizing for mitigating impacts on environment and climate, and enhancements in the safety and comfort of the living environment. Due to the significant increases in internet speed and accessibility and the drops in computer prices and data storage costs in recent years, Big Data (BD) nowadays plays an important supplementary role to AI. Algorithms and computer codes have been developed for data mining and analysis. BD rejuvenates AI methods and applications in many areas, including sustainable architecture. The present paper starts with an introduction to AI history and techniques. This is followed by a discussion on how AI and BD can be used to design and operate energy–efficient commercial buildings and residential houses, followed by a review of recent applications of AI and BD to energy-efficient buildings with an emphasis on the use of machine learning (ML) and large databases.

This study presents a novel application of four advanced artificial intelligence models namely the Minimax Probability Machine Regression (MPMR), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) and Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) for forecasting lake level fluctuation in Lake Huron utilizing historical datasets. The MPMR is a probabilistic framework that employed Mercer Kernels to achieve nonlinear regression models. The GPR, which is a probabilistic technique used tractable Bayesian framework for generalization of multivariate distribution of input samples to vast dimensional space. The ELM is a capable algorithm-based model for the implementation of the single-layer feed-forward neural network. The RVM demonstrate depends on the specification of the Bayesian method on a linear model with proper preceding that results in demonstration of sparse. The recommended techniques were tested to evaluate the current lake water-level trend monthly from the historical datasets at four previous time steps. The Lake Huron levels from 1918 to 1993 was managed for the training phase, and the rest of data (from 1994 to 2013) was used for testing. Considering the monthly and annually previous time steps, six models were introduced and found that the best results are achieved for a model with (t-1, t-2, t-3, t-12) as input combinations. The results show that all models can forecast the lake levels precisely. The results of this research study exhibit that the MPMR model (R2 = 0.984; MAE = 0.035; RMSE = 0.044; ENS = 0.984; DRefined = 0.995; ELM = 0.874) found to be more precise in lake level forecasting.

It is oriented to evaluate skills in the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context. The proposal helps the students to turn theoretical concepts into more tangible objects where they can build their knowledge by programming their implementations in software. Then, programming codes for practicing the neural networks theory, finite impulse response, empirical mode decomposition and discrete wavelet transform are achieved to compare percentage classification between different techniques. Also, it measures the interaction between the student and the theoretical mathematics of artificial intelligence. The continuous evaluations at the end of the practical sessions corroborate the increase in the knowledge of the students. A study based on rubrics illustrates an increase in the average grade obtained by the students in the elaboration of each practice.

But artisanal products (e.g., handmade textiles) are valued precisely because of their human origins, and thus have some inherent “immunity” from AI job loss. At the same time, artisanal labor, combined with technology, could potentially help to democratize the economy, allowing independent, small-scale businesses to flourish. Could AI, robotics and related automation technologies enhance the economic viability and environmental sustainability of these beloved crafting professions, perhaps even expanding their niche to replace some job loss in other sectors? In this paper, we compare the problems created by the current mass production economy and potential solutions from an artisanal economy. In doing so, the paper details the possibilities of utilizing AI to support hybrid forms of human–machine production at the microscale; localized and sustainable value chains at the mesoscale; and networks of these localized and sustainable producers at the macroscale. In short, a wide range of automation technologies are potentially available for facilitating and empowering an artisanal economy.

Given the international mantra of cost quality & service companies need to adopt technology in a proactive manner by collaborating with IT department. Traditionally HR and IT have operated as distinct units. But with the changing times there is an urgent need to adopt technology for improving the productivity of human resources thereby contributing to the sustainable organizational development. So a close collaboration between these two departments is called for. Some of the HR professionals assume that technology will fix all their problems i.e. By moving to cloud the outdated HR operating model and disconnected data sourcing issues will get resolved. But HR professionals will be committing a grave mistake if they think that the technology will be a panacea to all HR problems. In other words, the key is about how the technology is applied and not the acquisition of technology. In the prevailing competitive environment there is every need to understand appreciate the behaviour of the employees so that required initiatives could be taken for obtaining outstanding performance from these valuable human resources. In this regard technological tools like HR Analytics(HRA) Artificial Intelligence (AI) come very handy for getting valuable insights into human behaviour. Further application of these tools helps in effective decision making thereby contributing to the accomplishment of organization goals. Application of HRA and AI apart from facilitating decision making also helps in integrating Human Resource with other business activities. The paper focusses on understanding how HR analytics helps in sustainable human resource management by providing insights into elementary HR processes and behaviours.

Prevalence will continue to rise and is estimated to reach 3% of the population in Western countries by 2025. It is the most important cause of hospitalisation in subjects aged 65 years or more, resulting in high costs and major social impact. The current “one-size-fits-all” approach in the treatment of HF does not result in best outcome for all patients. These facts are an imminent threat to good quality management of patients with HF. An unorthodox approach from a new vision on care is required. We propose a novel predictive, preventive and personalised medicine approach where patients are truly leading their management, supported by an easily accessible online application that takes advantage of artificial intelligence. This strategy paper describes the needs in HF care, the needed paradigm shift and the elements that are required to achieve this shift. Through the inspiring collaboration of clinical and high-tech partners from North-West Europe combining state of the art HF care, artificial intelligence, serious gaming and patient coaching, a virtual doctor is being created. The results are expected to advance and personalise self-care, where standard care tasks are performed by the patients themselves, in principle without involvement of healthcare professionals, the latter being able to focus on complex conditions.

The use of artistic media, instead of the prevalent technical and normative approaches to sustainability, allows to develop a reflective aesthetic enquiry, supporting a “learning by heart”, that should parallel analytical thinking. First, some key methodological elements to be applied to the playwriting process were defined. In particular, the process of interactive meaning-making among researchers, the multisensory knowing as forms of expression of the self and creativity and the experience of action. Moreover, the integration scientific knowledge, the communication of complexity and the focus of feelings, as element of authenticity, were considered. The methodological elements were integrated into the writing process of “The Wizard of RobOz”, inspired by Baum\'s novel, “The Wonderful Wizard of Oz”. The play focused on human identity, in contrast to robot identity. Feelings (altruism and love) emerged as the core of good choices. The contrast between human and non-human agents, was, then, resolved considering the importance of design in obtaining a good integration between the two worlds. The topic of the play is relevant at societal level, due to the foreseen transition to a “society 5.0”, where humans and non-human agents will have to be integrated. The evaluation phase showed that a coherent and structure story was generated though the fixed technique. However, the perceived authenticity and resonance evaluation should be implemented with further work. The focus on social sustainability of robotization and AI constituted a novelty with respect to previous works, which only investigated the technological application of robots to theatre. the use of a scientific literature review to support the brainstorming phase served to implement the integration between science and art. Another element of innovation was the use of professional performers, instead than scientists. In parallel, this play allowed to apply an open source robot design, building and programming for theatrical purpose. The large participation of public to the representation showed the potentiality to transfer this playwriting technique into the domains of new education and communication projects. However, it would be recommended to integrate, within the research and meaning-making process, the other dimensions of sustainability, as well as a relevant presence of ethical reasoning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd','study object',1,'playwriting technique to engage on a shared reflective enquiry about the social sustainability of robotization and artificial intelligence','end',NULL,'local','snapshot','future','qualitative','Italy',NULL,'Italy',0),('2-s2.0-85076174369','Today\'s globalized and highly competitive world market has broadened the spectrum of requirements in all the sectors of the agri-food industry.

This work presents a platform oriented to the application of IoT, Edge Computing, Artificial Intelligence and Blockchain techniques in Smart Farming environments, by means of the novel Global Edge Computing Architecture, and designed to monitor the state of dairy cattle and feed grain in real time, as well as ensure the traceability and sustainability of the different processes involved in production. The platform is deployed and tested in a real scenario on a dairy farm, demonstrating that the implementation of EC contributes to a reduction in data traffic and an improvement in the reliability in communications between the IoT-Edge layers and the Cloud. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'Precision agriculture','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','future','quantitative','Spain','Deductive','Spain',0),('2-s2.0-85076228940','As the global economy expands, both residential and commercial buildings consume an increasing proportion of the total energy that is used by buildings. Energy simulation and forecasting are important in setting energy policy and making decisions in pursuit of sustainable development. This work develops a new ensemble model, called the Evolutionary Neural Machine Inference Model (ENMIM), for estimating energy consumption in residential buildings based on actual data. The ensemble model combines two single supervised learning machines - least squares support vector regression (LSSVR), and the radial basis function neural network (RBFNN) –and incorporates symbiotic organism search (SOS) to find automatically its optimal tuning parameters. A set of real data, which were obtained from residential buildings in Ho Chi Minh City, Viet Nam, as well as experimental data from the literature were used to evaluate the performance of the developed model. Comparison results reveal that the ENMIM surpasses other benchmark models with respect to predictive accuracy. This work proves that the developed ensemble model is a promising alternative for the planning of energy management. Furthermore, the fact that the ENMIM has greater predictive accuracy than other artificial intelligence techniques suggests that the developed self-tuning ensemble model can be used in various disciplines. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd','study object',0,'estimating energy consumption in residential buildings','means','buzzword','local','snapshot','past','quantitative','Vietnam','Data collcted from Ho Chi Minh City; data generated by a software','Vietnam',0),('2-s2.0-85076529105','The presence of various forms of heavy metals (HMs) (e.g., Cu, Cd, Pb, Zn, Cr, Ni, As, Co, Hg, Fe, Mn, Sb, and Ce) in water bodies and sediment has been increasing due to industrial and agricultural runoff. HM removal in nature is highly stochastic, nonlinear, nonstationary, and redundant. Over the last two decades, the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) models for HM removal has been massively conducted. The divergence in the selection of predictors, target variables, the optimization, normalization of the algorithm, function, and architecture of AI models are time-consuming processes, which limit the optimal use of such models for HM removal simulation. The selection of sustainable, cost-efficient, and user-friendly treatment techniques that have minimal reverse impact on the ecosystem is immensely challenging. The focus of the established researches is to find an optimal AI models for specific removal techniques. Predictors and target variables can be sorted using several techniques, and the selection of algorithm, function, and architecture based on individual treatment techniques have been coherently ordered and argued. In this review, each element of the predictive models and their corresponding treatment processes, including its pros and cons, are discussed thoroughly. The performance matrices are also discussed in accordance with the behavior of each model. Moreover, multiple perspectives that can enlighten interested multi-domain scientists and scholars, such as AI model developers, data scientists, wastewater treatment researchers, and environmental policymakers, on the actual status of the models’ progression are summarized. A comprehensive gap and assessments are also conducted to provide an insightful vision on this topic.

This needs to be done while maintaining sustainable agricultural systems and simultaneously facing challenges such as a changing climate, depletion of water resources, and the potential for increased erosion and loss of productivity due to the occurrence of extreme weather events. Precision Agriculture emerged out of the advances in the 1980s because of the development of several key technologies like GPS and satellite imagery. This paper argues that with the increasing impact of climate change, the next revolution in precision agriculture and agriculture in general will be driven by Sustainable Precision Agriculture and Environment (SPAE, similar to the 7 Rs), which could leverage past technologies combined with Big Data analysis. This new, technology-focused SPAE transitions from a site-specific management focus to the notion of global sustainability. To accomplish this transition, we introduced the WebGIS framework as an organizing principle that connects local, site-specific data generators called smart farms to a regional and global view of agriculture that can support both the agricultural industry and policymakers in government. This will help integrate databases located in networks of networks into a system of systems to achieve the needed SPAE management and connect field, watershed, national, and worldwide sustainability.

However, the discourse carried out in public does not always correlate with the actual impact. Thus, we aimed to obtain both an overview of how French health professionals perceive the arrival of AI in daily practice and the perception of the other actors involved in AI to have an overall understanding of this issue. Methods: Forty French stakeholders with diverse backgrounds were interviewed in Paris between October 2017 and June 2018 and their contributions analyzed using the grounded theory method (GTM). Results: The interviews showed that the various actors involved all see AI as a myth to be debunked. However, their views differed. French healthcare professionals, who are strategically placed in the adoption of AI tools, were focused on providing the best and safest care for their patients. Contrary to popular belief, they are not always seeing the use of these tools in their practice. For healthcare industrial partners, AI is a true breakthrough but legal difficulties to access individual health data could hamper its development. Institutional players are aware that they will have to play a significant role concerning the regulation of the use of these tools. From an external point of view, individuals without a conflict of interest have significant concerns about the sustainability of the balance between health, social justice, and freedom. Health researchers specialized in AI have a more pragmatic point of view and hope for a better transition from research to practice. Conclusion: Although some hyperbole has taken over the discourse on AI in healthcare, diverse opinions and points of view have emerged among French stakeholders. The development of AI tools in healthcare will be satisfactory for everyone only by initiating a collaborative effort between all those involved.

In this research paper, artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely the cascade correlation neural networks (CCNN) and the random forest (RF) models, were employed in daily river stage and river flow prediction for two river systems (i.e., Dulhunty River and Herbert River) in Australia. To develop the CCNN and RF models, a significant 3-day antecedent river stage and river flow time series were used. 80% of the whole data were used for model training and the remaining 20% for model testing. A total of ten different model structures with different input combinations were used to evaluate the optimal model in the training phase, and the results were analyzed using statistical metrics including the root mean square error (RMSE), Nash–Sutcliffe coefficient (NS), Willmott’s index of agreement (WI), and Legate and McCabe’s index (ELM) in the testing phase. The inter-comparison of CCNN and RF models for both river systems showed that the CCNN model was able to generate a more accurate prediction of the river stage and river flow compared to the RF model. Due to hydro-geographic differences leading to a different underlying historical data characteristics, the optimal CCNN’s performance for the Dulhunty River was found to be most accurate, in terms of ELM = 0.779, WI = 0.964, and ENS = 0.862 versus 0.775, 0.968, and 0.885 for the Herbert River.

We conducted a forest inventory for measuring den-drometric variables and sampling woody materials and barks in a cerradão area in the state of Tocantins, Brazil. The Pe of cerradão biomass was estimated based on the observed higher calorific power and drier biomass values. Six vegetation indices were retrieved from a RapidEye image and tested for correlation to choose the optimum vegetation index for biomass modeling. The basal area and the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index were used as predictors in the Pe modeling. We estimated an average of 19.234 ± 0.411 GJ ton-1 and 19.878 ± 1.090 GJ ton-1 for higher heating values of the wood species and barks, respectively, and an average Pe of 1022.660 GJ ha-1. The best ANN showed an error of 11.3% by using a structure of two, eight, and one neurons in the input layer, in the hidden layer, and in the output layer, respectively, as well as activation functions of the tangential and sigmoidal types. The validation tests showed no significant difference between the observed and ANN-predicted values.

This region suffers from freshwater shortages and the identification of new groundwater sites is a critical need. Remote sensing and geographic information system (GIS) were used to reduce time and financial costs of rapid assessment of groundwater resources. Seventeen physiographical, hydrological, and geological groundwater conditioning factors (GWCFs) were derived from a spatial geo-database. Groundwater data were gathered in field surveys and well-yield data were acquired from the Iranian Department of Water Resources Management for 89 locations with high yield potential values ≥ 11 m3 h-1. These data were mapped in a GIS. From these locations, 62 (70%) were randomly selected to be used for model training, and the remaining 27 (30%) were used for validation of the model. The relative weights of the GWCFs were determined with an RF model. For GWPM, 220 randomly selected points in the study area and their final weights were determined with the VIKOR model. A groundwater potential map was created by interpolating the values at these points using Kriging in GIS. Finally, the area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve was plotted for the groundwater potential map. The success rate curve (SRC) was computed for the training dataset, and the prediction rate curve (PRC) was calculated for the validation dataset. Results of RF analysis show that land use and land cover, lithology, and elevation are the most significant determinants of groundwater occurrence.

To feed 10 billion persons 2050, we need to get the trade-offs right between sustainability, food security, food safety, and make better use of food already produced. The hierarchy of strategies for reducing food losses and waste are in descending order source reduction, reusing or reprocessing surplus foods, recycle food as feed for animals, recover the energy as biofuels, nutrients as compost, or raw materials for industry, while as last resorts one may consider recovering the energy by incineration or dumping as garbage in landfills. This paper will explore the trade-offs inherent when aiming at triple goals of sustainability, food security, and safety looking at these strategies for reducing food losses and waste and resource footprints. Intensification of food production and circular food systems could be parts of these solutions to future food security. In this regard could our future trade-offs be informed by the experiences from the use of antimicrobials to intensify food production and from the outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in terms of circular food production? There is no trade-off between intensification of food production aided by antimicrobials and the public health risks from antimicrobial resistance due to the zoo-technical use of antimicrobials. A sustainable future requires control of antimicrobial resistance. If one avoids that cycles of nutrients become cycles of pathogens and/or hazards, circular food production systems will a major contribution to the future sustainable food security.

Therefore, agriculture sustainability requires viable options such as supplemental irrigation to replenish the crop water requirements as and when needed. © 2020 by the authors.','method',0,'Accurate estimation of reference evapotranspiration for water resource management and sustainable agriculture','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','Canada','PEI dataset from mean values of the four sites’ climatic variables for capturing climatic variability from all parts of the province.','Canada',0),('2-s2.0-85082506668','Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Data Analytics; Economics; Land use; Smart city; Sustainable development; Urban growth; AI algorithms; AI Technologies; Disruptive technology; Sustainable urban development; Urban Informatics; Urban transportation','study object',1,'smart city;','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Australia',0),('2-s2.0-85082648103','Dublin [(CTY) Leinster]; Ireland; Leinster; Trixis; automobile; sustainability; urban area; urban design; urban politics; urban transport','study object',1,'autonomous transport','means','uneven socio-environmental transformations which undermined the sustainability of the city','local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Ireland','survey on public attitudes and adoption intentions regarding autonomous vehicles','Ireland',0),('2-s2.0-85082667976','Nowadays, sustainable development is considered a key concept and solution in creating a promising and prosperous future for human societies. Nevertheless, there are some predicted and unpredicted problems that epidemic diseases are real and complex problems. Hence, in this research work, a serious challenge in the sustainable development process was investigated using the classification of confirmed cases of COVID-19 (new version of Coronavirus) as one of the epidemic diseases. Hence, binary classification modeling was used by the group method of data handling (GMDH) type of neural network as one of the artificial intelligence methods. For this purpose, the Hubei province in China was selected as a case study to construct the proposed model, and some important factors, namely maximum, minimum, and average daily temperature, the density of a city, relative humidity, and wind speed, were considered as the input dataset, and the number of confirmed cases was selected as the output dataset for 30 days. The proposed binary classification model provides higher performance capacity in predicting the confirmed cases. In addition, regression analysis has been done and the trend of confirmed cases compared with the fluctuations of daily weather parameters (wind, humidity, and average temperature). The results demonstrated that the relative humidity and maximum daily temperature had the highest impact on the confirmed cases. The relative humidity in the main case study, with an average of 77.9%, affected positively, and maximum daily temperature, with an average of 15.4 ◦C, affected negatively, the confirmed cases. © 2020 by the authors.

This is getting recognized as a global challenge due to the rapid increase in life quality standards, demand, and the decrease in available resources. Thus, manufacturing, as a core of the product provision system and a fundamental pillar of civilized existence, is significantly influenced by sustainability issues. Furthermore, current manufacturing modeling and assessment criteria require intensive revisions and upgrades to keep up with these new challenges. Nearly all current manufacturing models are based on the old paradigm, which was proven to be inadequate. Therefore, manufacturing technology, along with culture and economy, are held responsible for providing new tools and opportunities for building novel resolutions towards a sustainable manufacturing concept. One of such tools is sustainability assessment measures. Revising and updating such tools is a core responsibility of the manufacturing sector to efficiently evaluate and enhance sustainable manufacturing performance. These measures should be adequate to respond to the growing sustainability concerns in pursuit of an integrated sustainability concept. The triple bottom line (TBL) that includes environment, economic, and social dimensions has usually been used to evaluate sustainability. However, there is a lack of standard sets of sustainable manufacturing performance measures. In addition to the sustainability concept, a new concept of smart manufacturing is emerging. The smart manufacturing concept takes advantage of the recent technological leap in Artificial Intelligent (AI), Cloud Computing (CC), and the Internet of Things (IoT). Although this concept offers an important step to boost the current production capabilities to meet the growing need, it is still not clear whether the two concepts of smart manufacturing and sustainability will constructively or destructively interact. Therefore, the current study aims to integrate the sustainable smart manufacturing performance by incorporating sustainable manufacturing measures and discussing current and future challenges that are faced by the manufacturing sector. In addition, the opportunities for future research incorporating sustainable smart manufacturing are also presented. © 2020 by authors.','method',1,'sustainable manufacturing','means','integrated sustainability concept.

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative exploratory analysis of four case studies of senior cohousing facilities located in different countries was performed. The cases analysed were selected as pioneering cases in the adoption of innovative and economically sustainable organizational solutions. Findings: The study made it possible to identify which are the common characters that successful experiences have highlighted. Although each facility needs to adapt to the social, cultural, demographic and economic context in which it is located, there are some recurring aspects, which have proved to be key success factors. Research limitations/implications: This research analyses only four cases. This suggests that the sample does not provide an exhaustive representation of the models adopted in this field. However, the study is an exploratory research and it can provide a basis for further analyses. Practical implications: This study provides valuable indications for the design and management of senior cohousing facilities, as regards the services to be offered, the network of services and facilities that can be complementary to the residences, the activities to be conducted and organized, the degree of involvement of the elderly in the planning of activities and services. With regard to the adoption of telehealth-related technologies, the study provides indications on which new technologies resulting from the industry 4.0 revolution are going to be adopted, that is, remote surveillance, remote diagnostics and the use of sensors and video. These technologies, thanks to the artificial intelligence, can detect anomalies and provide predictive analyses on the behaviour and health of the elderly. Originality/value: The study made it possible to identify the key success factors for senior cohousing facilities regardless of the characteristics of the context in which they are located. In addition, it provides a first analysis of the potential of telehealth-related technological solutions, paving the way for further studies aimed at assessing how, thanks to new technologies, the level of economic sustainability of senior cohousing solutions can be improved. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.','study object',1,'new technology in senior cohousing facilities','means',NULL,'supranational','snapshot',NULL,'qualitative','multiple','seondary data (reports, website information)','Italy',0),('2-s2.0-85083626852',NULL,'study object',1,'smart city; health care','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Australia',1),('2-s2.0-85083646089','Recent significant changes in technology such as Artificial Intelligence (AI) and big data analysis have a wide impact in many areas of human societies, not least in education. Advances in efficiency of new technologies, with impacts in renewable energy and transport affected by environmental concerns and climate change mitigation, demand a reassessment and adjustment of the industrial structure of the economy. Technological advances enhancing creativity and analytical skills mean people must learn and adapt to a fast-changing economic environment. This paper present some key changes in Australian educational areas in recent years that are important and relevant to the subject of education innovation and philosophy to achieve outcomes in training and sustainable economic development, as anticipated by the community and government. Education courses and curricula in many countries have been transformed by technological advance. It is the swift incorporation of new technologies that best prepares students for the dynamics of economic and social change. Even though technological responsiveness is not a new phenomenon, it is established that the teaching methods found to be most successful include complementary and supplemental courses producing multi-skilled and creative graduates. These courses are delivered with significant emphasis upon self-development skills and are less focused upon traditional content. A move toward horizontal focus and a student-centric balance is the current trend, displacing vertical over-specialisation of learning. Yet, the central role of educator is seen as still appropriate and necessary where the aim is to equip graduates with creative and adaptive skills. © 2020, © 2020 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.','method',0,'impact of artificial intelligence upon the education sector','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Australia',NULL,'Vietnam',0),('2-s2.0-85083665272','artificial intelligence; intelligent transportation system; smart city; unmanned vehicle; urban development','study object',0,'smart city; mobility and transport','end',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United Kingdom',0),('2-s2.0-85083806859','Architectural design; Climate control; Cluster analysis; Data mining; Data visualization; Energy utilization; Filtration; Urban planning; Accurate quantifications; Artificial intelligence technologies; Building energy use; Economic and social development; Sustainable communities; Technical difficulties; Urban-Scale Energy Consumption; Visualization platforms; Energy efficiency','study object',0,'energy consumption and management; building-level','means','sustainable community design',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'China',0),('2-s2.0-85083912794','The so-called fourth revolution in the water sector will encounter the Big data and Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution.

A subdomain of AI is machine learning (ML), which “learns” intrinsic statistical patterns in data to eventually cast predictions on unseen data. Deep learning is a ML technique using multi-layer mathematical operations for learning and inferring on complex data like imagery. This succinct narrative review describes the application, limitations and possible future of AI-based dental diagnostics, treatment planning, and conduct, for example, image analysis, prediction making, record keeping, as well as dental research and discovery. AI-based applications will streamline care, relieving the dental workforce from laborious routine tasks, increasing health at lower costs for a broader population, and eventually facilitate personalized, predictive, preventive, and participatory dentistry. However, AI solutions have not by large entered routine dental practice, mainly due to 1) limited data availability, accessibility, structure, and comprehensiveness, 2) lacking methodological rigor and standards in their development, 3) and practical questions around the value and usefulness of these solutions, but also ethics and responsibility. Any AI application in dentistry should demonstrate tangible value by, for example, improving access to and quality of care, increasing efficiency and safety of services, empowering and enabling patients, supporting medical research, or increasing sustainability. Individual privacy, rights, and autonomy need to be put front and center; a shift from centralized to distributed/federated learning may address this while improving scalability and robustness. Lastly, trustworthiness into, and generalizability of, dental AI solutions need to be guaranteed; the implementation of continuous human oversight and standards grounded in evidence-based dentistry should be expected. Methods to visualize, interpret, and explain the logic behind AI solutions will contribute (“explainable AI”).

It is therefore imperative to improve the prediction accuracy of solar power to prepare for the unknown conditions in the future. So far, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms such as machine learning and deep learning have been widely-reported with competitive prediction performance because they can reveal the invariant structure and nonlinear features in solar data. However, these reports have not been fully reviewed. Accordingly, this paper provides a taxonomy research of the existing solar power forecasting models based on AI algorithms. Taxonomy is a process of systematically dividing solar energy prediction methods, optimizers and prediction frameworks into several categories based on their differences and similarities.

A series of fundamental questions have been raised about AI-driven health interventions, and whether the tools, methods, and protections traditionally used to make ethical and evidence-based decisions about new technologies can be applied to AI. Deployment of AI has already begun for a broad range of health issues common to LMICs, with interventions focused primarily on communicable diseases, including tuberculosis and malaria. Types of AI vary, but most use some form of machine learning or signal processing. Several types of machine learning methods are frequently used together, as is machine learning with other approaches, most often signal processing. AI-driven health interventions fit into four categories relevant to global health researchers: (1) diagnosis, (2) patient morbidity or mortality risk assessment, (3) disease outbreak prediction and surveillance, and (4) health policy and planning. However, much of the AI-driven intervention research in global health does not describe ethical, regulatory, or practical considerations required for widespread use or deployment at scale. Despite the field remaining nascent, AI-driven health interventions could lead to improved health outcomes in LMICs. Although some challenges of developing and deploying these interventions might not be unique to these settings, the global health community will need to work quickly to establish guidelines for development, testing, and use, and develop a user-driven research agenda to facilitate equitable and ethical use. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd','study object',0,'AI health interventions in low-middle income countries','means','SDGs','supranational',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85084901408','As a core driving force of the most recent round of industrial transformation, artificial intelligence has triggered significant changes in the world economic structure, profoundly changed our life and way of thinking, and achieved an overall leap in social productivity. This paper aims to examine the effect of knowledge transfer performance on the artificial intelligence industry innovation network and the path artificial intelligence enterprises can take to promote sustainable development through knowledge transfer in the above context. First, we construct a theoretical hypothesis and conceptual model of the innovation network knowledge transfer mechanism within the artificial intelligence industry. Then, we collect data from questionnaires distributed to Chinese artificial intelligence enterprises that participate in the innovation network. Moreover, we empirically analyze the impact of innovation network characteristics, organizational distance, knowledge transfer characteristics, and knowledge receiver characteristics on knowledge transfer performance and verify the hypotheses proposed in the conceptual model. The results indicate that innovation network centrality and organizational culture distance have a significant effect on knowledge transfer performance, with influencing factors including network scale, implicit knowledge transfer, receiver\'s willingness to receive, and receiver\'s capacity to absorb knowledge.

To tackle the long-standing energy scarcity issue that currently plagues sensor network (SN) systems, energy harvesting is explored and exploited to maximize its untapped potential to develop asuccessive wireless power sensor network (WPSN) system embedded with a scheduling algorithm, and operate as a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system. Similarly, quality of service parameters are crucial design considerations for network efficiency,and energy efficiency (EE) is considered here. Consequently, an EE optimization problem is formulated for the successiveWPSN system and solved by exploiting the problem structure and through a meta-heuristic algorithm. The new system is validated through the numerical simulation results presented in this work by thoroughly analyzing, evaluating and comparing the proposed meta-heuristic based WPSN system with the baseline state-of-the-art WPSN systems that combined a meta-heuristic algorithm, two additional meta-heuristic algorithms including genetic algorithm (GA) and ant-colony optimization (ACO) algorithm as well as a non-meta-heuristic algorithm – specifically an iterative based Dinkelbach algorithm.The experimental outcomes show that the proposed system significantly outperforms the contemporary WPSN systems in terms of EE performance gains. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'Energy efficiency maximization for water quality monitoring','means',NULL,NULL,'snapshot','present','quantitative',NULL,NULL,'South Africa',0),('2-s2.0-85084939527','Climate change impacts are a serious threat to food provisioning, security and the economy. Thus, assessing agricultural suitability and yield reduction under climate change is crucial for sustainable agricultural production. In this study, we used two sub-models of the agro-ecological decision support system MicroLEIS (Terraza and Cervatana) to evaluate the impacts of climate change on land capability and yield reduction or wheat and sunflower as major rainfed crops in different Mediterranean soil types (in Andalucia, Southern Spain). The Terraza sub-model provides an experimental prediction for the bioclimate deficiency and yield reduction, while the Cervatana sub-model predicts the general land use suitability for specific agricultural uses. Sixty-two districts in Southern Spain were modeled and mapped using soil data and the A1B climate scenario (balanced scenario) for three 30-year periods ending in 2040, 2070 and 2100, respectively. Our results showed that the majority of agricultural soils were suitable for wheat production, and less for sunflowers, especially under projected climate change scenarios. Extreme impacts of climate change were observed in the soil types Typic Xerofluvents and Calcic Haploxerepts, where the land capability was reduced from Good and Moderate classes to the Marginal class. This was especially observed in sunflower crops by 2100. Yield reduction of sunflower was much higher than the reduction for wheat, especially under the projected climate periods, where the results for 2100 showed the severest effect on crop yields with about 95% of the sunflower area showing yield reductions.

They are commonly acquired with pyranometer sensor device. However, due to its high initial and maintenance costs it is not densely deployed in the field. Consequently, it provides only limited coverage as a data source for solar radiation. Hence, theoretical, empirical and/or data-driven models are utilized to estimate solar radiation in areas without pyranometers using only data from meteorological sensor stations, which on the other hand are widely available and obtained from sustainable sensor networks. In this paper, end to end process is described for building hybrid models for solar radiation using Artificial Intelligence (AI), or more specifically Machine Learning (ML) methods, after which a detailed analysis is performed on (1) the accuracy of the models regards to their parameters and input features, (2) the sustainability of the models in the real world, and finally (3) their feasibility in (near) real-time monitoring. The results are expressed with relative root mean squared error (RRMSE) and they show that hybrid models outperform model- and data-driven ones, with artificial neural network giving the best results (RRMSE = 0.0393). Additionally, the models can be enhanced by performing an informed feature selection, where a posteriori selection proves to be better than a priori selection (RRMSE = 0.0371). Further investigation shows that randomly selected input data gives faster model convergence as expected. However, sequential input data can match it if model training starts with autumn or spring data when weather exhibits sufficient variety. When applied on different times scales, all models perform best on 3h scale rather than daily, where random forest (RRMSE = 0.0275) outperforms neural network (RRMSE = 0.0315). However, for (near) real time usage the models perform almost the same as for daily, with RRMSE of 0.0469 for 1min scale with neural network.

The outbreak of new coronavirus (COVID-19) as an infectious disease showed that it has undesirable social, environmental, and economic impacts, and leads to serious challenges and threats. Additionally, investigating the prioritization parameters is of vital importance to reducing the negative impacts of this global crisis. Hence, the main aim of this study is to prioritize and analyze the role of certain environmental parameters. For this purpose, four cities in Italy were selected as a case study and some notable climate parameters—such as daily average temperature, relative humidity, wind speed—and an urban parameter, population density, were considered as input data set, with confirmed cases of COVID-19 being the output dataset. In this paper, two artificial intelligence techniques, including an artificial neural network (ANN) based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and differential evolution (DE) algorithm, were used for prioritizing climate and urban parameters. The analysis is based on the feature selection process and then the obtained results from the proposed models compared to select the best one. Finally, the difference in cost function was about 0.0001 between the performances of the two models, hence, the two methods were not different in cost function, however, ANN-PSO was found to be better, because it reached to the desired precision level in lesser iterations than ANN-DE.

However, the integration brings about considerable technical challenges associated with fluctuations and uncertainties of the energy availability whilst maintaining the stability of smart grids. The prediction of renewable energy generation is key to achieve optimal power dispatch in renewable-intensive smart grids. However, uncertain interruption and prediction errors will make an optimal decision more challenging. Model predictive control (MPC) is an effective way to overcome the discrepancies between the prediction and the real-world system through a closed-loop correction over iteration process. This study develops an improved MPC scheme used with a hybrid energy storage system for optimal power dispatch in a smart grid. This hybrid renewable energy system consists of a wind farm, a hydrogen/oxygen storage system and several fuel cells (FCs). In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) with a back propagation (BP) artificial neural network is developed to predict the wind energy availability by using measured data. Then, a genetic algorithm (GA) is combined with a state space model (SSM) to achieve the MPC control. A dataset of 24-hour ahead predictive generation is calibrated from the measured data and is defined for optimal power flow between the grid, the wind farm and the storage subsystem so as to balance the supply and load. The optimization target is to achieve a minimal energy exchange between the power grid and the hybrid renewable energy storage system. Based on actual measured data, the test results have shown that the proposed methodology can maximize the local usage of wind power whilst minimizing the power exchange with the grid. An optimal power dispatch strategy is proved to be effective to meet the demand and efficiency with dynamic control of the FCs. The usage of the intermittent wind power is increased from 45% to 90% in the four test studies. Therefore, this work can minimize the impact of fluctuating renewable energy on the power grid and enhance uptakes of FC-based energy systems.

This study proposed an artificial intelligence-based WFE system-overarching solution driven by hybrid hydro-floating photovoltaic power generation for promoting nexus synergies. A multi-objective optimization model grounded upon the Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm was developed to simultaneously maximize hydro-floating photovoltaic power output, the ratio of water storage to reservoir capacity, and the ratio of water supply to water demand. The Shihmen Reservoir watershed and its WFE system in northern Taiwan constituted the case study. The results demonstrated that the proposed optimization model could significantly improve synergistic benefits of the WFE nexus by reaching 13%, 13.3% and 15.1% in water storage, food production and hydro-floating photovoltaic power output, respectively. The optimal tilt angles of floating photovoltaic installation would vary between −11.9° (Summer) and 44.3° (Winter). This study opens up new perspectives on green energy production expansion while stimulating WFE nexus synergies in support of policy-makers with feasible schemes on floating photovoltaic deployment in the interest of social sustainability.

The preservation and improvement of the quality of our impaired urban streams are at the core of the global challenge of ensuring water sustainability. This work adopted a genetic-algorithm (GA)-optimized long short-term memory (LSTM) technique to predict river water temperature (WT) as a key indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitat, where its modeling is crucial for effective urban water quality management. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adopt a GA-LSTM to predict the WT in urban rivers. In recent research trends, large volumes of real-time water quality data, including water temperature, conductivity, pH, and turbidity, are constantly being collected. Specifically, in the field of water quality management, this provides countless opportunities for understanding water quality impairment and forecasting, and to develop models for aquatic habitat assessment purposes. The main objective of this research was to develop a reliable and simple urban river water temperature forecasting tool using advanced machine learning methods that can be used in conjunction with a real-time network of water quality monitoring stations for proactive water quality management. We proposed a hybrid time series regression model for WT forecasting. This hybrid approach was applied to solve problems regarding the time window size and architectural factors (number of units) of the LSTM network. We have chosen an hourly water temperature record collected over 5 years as the input. Furthermore, to check its robustness, a recurrent neural network (RNN) was also tested as a benchmark model and the performances were compared. The experimental results revealed that the hybrid model of the GA-LSTM network outperformed the RNN and the basic problem of determining the optimal time window and number of units of the memory cell was solved. This research concluded that the GA-LSTM can be used as an advanced deep learning technique for time series analysis. © 2020 by the authors.','study object',0,'predict river water temperature (WT) as a key indicator of the health state of the aquatic habitat','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','Canada','hourly water temperature record collected over 5 years from Credit Valley Conservation Authority (CVC)','Canada',0),('2-s2.0-85088160474','In recent decades, various conventional techniques have been formulated around the world to evaluate the overall water quality (WQ) at particular locations. In the present study, back propagation neural network (BPNN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector regression (SVR), and one multilinear regression (MLR) are considered for the prediction of water quality index (WQI) at three stations, namely Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), across the Yamuna River, India. The nonlinear ensemble technique was proposed using the neural network ensemble (NNE) approach to improve the performance accuracy of the single models. The observed WQ parameters were provided by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) including dissolved oxygen (DO), pH, biological oxygen demand (BOD), ammonia (NH3), temperature (T), and WQI. The performance of the models was evaluated by various statistical indices. The obtained results indicated the feasibility of the developed data intelligence models for predicting the WQI at the three stations with the superior modelling results of the NNE. The results also showed that the minimum values for root mean square (RMS) varied between 0.1213 and 0.4107, 0.003 and 0.0367, and 0.002 and 0.0272 for Nizamuddin, Palla, and Udi (Chambal), respectively.

Sustainable irrigation is the rational practice of all the activities related to water application on the crops. In irrigation, the rationality of intelligent agents can be used to reach soil water content near the field capacity to increase yields and reduce waste of water. Rationality in artificial intelligence is the capability of the intelligent agents to decide their actions. This paper discusses how incorporating intelligent agents on irrigation systems allows significant advances in respect of current irrigation approaches. This paper review not only focuses on intelligent reactive systems as usual, but rather discloses developments in systems that incorporate other behaviors such as proactivity, planning, learning, social abilities, organization, coordination and negotiation. From the literature review, it is found that the use of soil, plant and environmental sensors, as well as reasoning, learning and communication capabilities, provides innovative technological support to improve sustainability in irrigated agriculture. The review also shows that intelligent agents can adequately consider the timing and the amount of water to apply according to the spatio-temporal variations of the soil–plant–atmosphere system. It is concluded that significant improvements in water savings and crop yield can be achieved incorporating artificial intelligence into precision irrigation.

Therefore, the concept of \"biobank 3.0\"was introduced so that biobanks could better meet the needs of stakeholders and maintain sustainable operations. Theoretically, the Taiwan Biobank (TWB) has already gone through the concepts of biobank 1.0 and 2.0. However, three challenges still need to be addressed before it can be transformed into a new generation of the TWB (namely, the TWB 3.0): (1) the difficulty of integrating other biobanks\' resources, (2) the efficiency and effectiveness of the release and use of biospecimens/data, and (3) the development of income and revenue models of sustainability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a framework for the TWB 3.0 transformation based on a dual-pillar approach composed of a \"physically\"vertical integration driven by the TWB and a \"virtually\"horizontal network led by the National Health Research Institutes (NHRI) of Taiwan. Using prominent biobanks such as the Biobanking and BioMolecular Resources Research Infrastructure-European Research Infrastructure Consortium (BBMRI-ERIC), the UK Biobank, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)\'s All of Us Research Program as models, the TWB can strengthen its on-going TWB 2.0 operations in regional and/or international collaboration, increase the value of data collected and develop closer relationships with biobank participants and users.

However, linked administrative data can be complex to use and may require advanced expertise and skills in statistical analysis. The main objectives of this study were to describe the current use of data linkage at the individual level and artificial intelligence (AI) in routine public health activities, to identify the related estimated health indicators (i.e., outcome and intervention indicators) and health determinants of non-communicable diseases and the obstacles to linking different data sources. Method: We performed a survey across European countries to explore the current practices applied by national institutes of public health, health information and statistics for innovative use of data sources (i.e., the use of data linkage and/or AI). Results: The use of data linkage and AI at national institutes of public health, health information and statistics in Europe varies. The majority of European countries use data linkage in routine by applying a deterministic method or a combination of two types of linkages (i.e., deterministic & probabilistic) for public health surveillance and research purposes. The use of AI to estimate health indicators is not frequent at national institutes of public health, health information and statistics. Using linked data, 46 health outcome indicators, 34 health determinants and 23 health intervention indicators were estimated in routine. The complex data regulation laws, lack of human resources, skills and problems with data governance, were reported by European countries as obstacles to routine data linkage for public health surveillance and research. Conclusions: Our results highlight that the majority of European countries have integrated data linkage in their routine public health activities but only a few use AI. A sustainable national health information system and a robust data governance framework allowing to link different data sources are essential to support evidence-informed health policy development.

As the smart grid has evolved through a growing scale of interconnection, increasing integration of renewable energy, widespread operation of direct current power transmission systems, and liberalization of electricity markets, the stability characteristics of it are much more complex than the past. Due to these changes, conventional stability analysis and control approaches have a series of drawbacks in terms of speed, effectiveness and economy.

Yet, looking through a political economy lens, it is clear that AI is not advancing sustainability nearly as much as industry leaders are claiming. As this article argues, the metrics and rhetoric of corporate social responsibility are exaggerating the benefits and obscuring the costs of AI. Productivity and efficiency gains in the middle sections of supply chains are rebounding into more production and consumption, doing far more to enhance the profitability of big business than the sustainability of the earth.

In this paper, we make use of Open Data sources, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors and installations distributed across Europe to create such tool through the application of Artificial Neural Networks. We analyze how the different factors affect the prediction of energy production and how Open Data can be used to predict the expected output of sustainable sources. As a result, we facilitate users the necessary information to decide how much they wish to invest according to the desired energy output for their particular location. Compared to state-of-the-art proposals, our solution provides an abstraction layer focused on energy production, rather that radiation data, and can be trained and tailored for different locations using Open Data. Finally, our tests show that our proposal improves the accuracy of the forecasting, obtaining a lower mean squared error (MSE) of 0.040 compared to an MSE 0.055 from other proposals in the literature. © 2020 by the authors.','study object',0,'prediction of solar energy output','means','sustainable energy solutions','supranational','longitudinal','past','quantitative','multiple','Open Data from Photovoltaic Geographical Information System','Spain',0),('2-s2.0-85091474084','Background: The world is experiencing a dramatic increase in the aging population, challenging the sustainability of traditional care models that have relied on in-person monitoring. This debate article discusses whether artificial intelligence health monitoring may be suitable enhancement or replacement for elder care. Main text: Internationally, as life expectancy continues to rise, many countries are facing a severe shortage of direct care workers. The health workforce is aging, and replacement remains a challenge. Artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies may play a novel and significant role in filling the human resource gaps in caring for older adults by complementing current care provision, reducing the burden on family caregivers, and improving the quality of care. Nonetheless, opportunities brought on by these emerging technologies raise ethical questions that must be addressed to ensure that these automated systems can truly enhance care and health outcomes for older adults. This debate article explores some ethical dimensions of using automated health monitoring technologies. It argues that, in order for these health monitoring technologies to fulfill the wishes of older adults to age in place and also to empower them and improve their quality of life, we need deep knowledge of how stakeholders may balance their considerations of relational care, safety, and privacy. Conclusion: It is only when we design artificial intelligence health monitoring technologies with intersecting clinical and ethical factors in mind that the resulting systems will enhance productive relational care, facilitate independent living, promote older adults\' health outcomes, and minimize waste. © 2020 The Author(s).','study object',0,'AI in elder care','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Canada',0),('2-s2.0-85091803788','Artificial intelligence (AI) brings forth many opportunities to contribute to the wellbeing of individuals and the advancement of economies and societies, but also a variety of novel ethical, legal, social, and technological challenges.

These factors are threatening the environmental and economic sustainability of current and future food supply systems. Scientific and technological innovations are needed more than ever to secure enough food for a fast-growing global population. Scientific advances have led to a better understanding of how various components of the agricultural system interact, from the cell to the field level. Despite incredible advances in genetic tools over the past few decades, our ability to accurately assess crop status in the field, at scale, has been severely lacking until recently. Thanks to recent advances in remote sensing and Artificial Intelligence (AI), we can now quantify field scale phenotypic information accurately and integrate the big data into predictive and prescriptive management tools.

The utilisation of the hydrocarbons and biomass in SOFCs is particularly attractive owing to their wide distribution, high energy density, and low price. The long-term operation of SOFCs using such fuels remains difficult owing to a lack of an effective diagnosis and optimisation system, which requires not only a precise analysis but also a fast response. In this study, we developed a hybrid model for an on-line analysis of SOFCs at the cell level. The model combines a multi-physics simulation (MPS) and deep learning, overcoming the complexity of MPS for a model-based control system, and reducing the cost of building a database (compared with the experiments) for the training of a deep neural network. The maximum temperature gradient and heat generation are two target parameters for an efficient operation of SOFCs. The results show that a precise prediction can be achieved from a trained AI algorithm, in which the relative error between the MPS and AI models is less than 1%. Moreover, an online optimisation is realised using a genetic algorithm, achieving the maximum power density within the limitations of the temperature gradient and operating conditions. This method can also be applied to the prediction and optimisation of other non-liner, dynamic systems. © 2020 The Author(s)','method',0,'optimisation of solid oxide fuel cell performance (storing electricity)','means','sustainable energy',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United Kingdom',0),('2-s2.0-85092895870',NULL,'study object',1,'smart city; urban design and planning','end',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','qualitative','United Arab Emirates','interviews','Ireland',0),('2-s2.0-85092904760','air quality; artificial intelligence; atmospheric pollution; banking; financial market; marketing; robotics; sustainable development; trend analysis; urban area','study object',1,'smart city;','end','capacity of cities to meet the needs of present and future generations while maintaining or enhancing social equity, economic prosperity, environmental quality, and governance effectiveness',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Australia',0),('2-s2.0-85092906494','The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is undergoing a major transformation in response to a revolutionary vision of 2030, given that healthcare reform is one of the top priorities.

Artificial intelligence methods can provide new possibilities for runoff prediction when the underlying physical relationship cannot be explicitly obtained. However, few reports evaluate the performances of various artificial intelligence methods in forecasting daily streamflow time series for sustainable water resources management by far. To refill this research gap, the potentials of five artificial intelligence methods in daily streamflow series prediction are examined, including artificial neural network (ANN), adaptive neural-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), extreme learning machine (ELM), Gaussian process regression (GPR) and support vector machine (SVM). Four quantitative statistical indexes are chosen as the evaluation benchmarks. The results from two huge hydropower reservoirs in China show that five artificial intelligence methods can achieve satisfying forecasting results, while the SVM, GPR and ELM methods can produce better performances than ANN and ANFIS in both training and testing phases with respective to four indexes.

In the present study, the Artificial Neural Network (ANN), optimized with a Genetic Algorithm (GA-ANN), was employed for seasonal groundwater table depth (GWTD) prediction in the area between the Ganga and Hindon rivers located in Uttar Pradesh State, India. A total of 18 models for both seasons (nine for the pre-monsoon and nine for the post-monsoon) have been formulated by using groundwater recharge (GWR), groundwater discharge (GWD), and previous groundwater level data from a 21-year period (1994–2014). The hybrid GA-ANN models’ predictive ability was evaluated against the traditional GA models based on statistical indicators and visual inspection. The results appraisal indicates that the hybrid GA-ANN models outperformed the GA models for predicting the seasonal GWTD in the study region. Overall, the hybrid GA-ANN-8 model with an 8-9-1 structure (i.e., 8: inputs, 9: neurons in the hidden layer, and 1: output) was nominated optimal for predicting the GWTD during pre-and post-monsoon seasons. Additionally, it was noted that the maximum number of input variables in the hybrid GA-ANN approach improved the prediction accuracy. In conclusion, the proposed hybrid GA-ANN model’s findings could be readily transferable or implemented in other parts of the world, specifically those with similar geology and hydrogeology conditions for sustainable planning and groundwater resources management. © 2020 by the authors.

Performance evaluation translates into key performance indicators (KPIs) with a high impact on increasing overall efficacy and efficiency. As the pool of KPIs has increased over time in the context of evaluating the supply chain management (SCM) system’s performance and assessing, communicating and managing its risks, a mathematical model based on neural networks has been developed. The SCM system has been structured into subsystems with the most relevant KPIs for set subsystems and their most important contributions on the increase in the overall SCM system performance and sustainability. As a result of the performed research based on the interview method, the five most relevant KPIs of each SCM subsystem and the most relevant problems are underlined. The main goal of this paper is to develop a performance evaluation model that links specific problems with the most relevant KPIs for every subsystem of the supply chain management. This paper demonstrates that by using data mining, the relationship between certain problems that appear in the supply chain management of every company and specific KPIs can be identified. The paper concludes with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on neural networks using the multilayer perceptron artificial intelligence algorithm where the most trustworthy KPIs for each selected problem can be predicted. This aspect provides a highly innovative contribution in solving supply chain management problems provided by organizations by allowing them to holistically track, communicate, analyze and improve the SCM system and ensure overall system sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.

This article focuses on studying those similarities regarding robotics to advance agriculture toward the concept of “intelligent farms” (smart farms). Thus, this article presents some characteristics that agricultural robots should gain from industrial robots to attain the intelligent farm concept regarding robot morphologies and features as well as communication, computing, and data management techniques. The study, restricted to robotics for outdoor farms due to the fact that robotics for greenhouse farms deserves a specific study, reviews different structures for robot manipulators and mobile robots along with the latest techniques used in intelligent factories to advance the characteristics of robotics for future intelligent farms. This article determines similarities, contrasts, and differences between industrial and field robots and identifies some techniques proven in the industry with an extraordinary potential to be used in outdoor farms such as those derived from methods based on artificial intelligence, cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, Big Data techniques, and cloud computing procedures.

The gully erosion susceptibility maps (GESMs), prepared by MLP, MLP-Bagging and MLP-Dagging were classified into four classes such as low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility classes with the help of natural break method (NBM) in GIS environment. The very high susceptibility class covered 19.41% (MLP), 13.52% (MLP-Bagging) and 15.30% (MLP-Dagging) areas of the basin.

This research work is committed towards the enhancement of biohydrogen and biobutanol production by single and multi-parameter optimization for the improvement of substrate energy recovery using C. saccharoperbutylacetonicum. Single parameters optimization (SPO) manifested that headspace of 60% (v/v) and butyric acid supplementation of 9 g/L and temperatures of 30 °C and 37 °C were suitable for obtaining maximum biohydrogen and biobutanol production, respectively. The interaction between these parameters was further evaluated by implementing a 5-level 3-factor Central Composite Design (CCD). In the present study, a central composite design was employed to enhance the biohydrogen and biobutanol production. In addition, the experimental results were analyzed by response surface methodology (RSM) and artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as artificial neural network (ANN). The prediction capability of RSM was further compared with ANN for predicting the optimum parameters that would lead to maximum biohydrogen and biobutanol production. ANN yielded higher values of biohydrogen and biobutanol. ANN was found to be superior as compared to RSM in terms of prediction accuracy for both biohydrogen and biobutanol because of its higher coefficient of determination (R2) and lower root mean square error (RMSE) value.

The methodology we describe offers immediate pointers to participants through the use of the Meeting Mediator (MM), an online intervention tool that shows the conversational balance of participants and offers immediate feedback to team members, with limited intermediation of the researchers. Both the experimental group—exposed to the MM—and the control group completed two tasks, which involved making a series of complex decisions as a group in the form of two moral reasoning tasks. Results confirmed that participants exposed to the MM experienced approximately twice as large of an increase in self-assessed dominance over the control group as those who were exposed only once. This effect is also present on repeated exposures, and becomes more pronounced with each subsequent exposure. When participants were exposed to the MM either in the first task or in the second task, their performance increased, though we found no positive impact when groups were exposed several times to it.

The results of this study established that the population and air quality index of a region had a statistically significant influence on the cases. However, age and the human development index had a negative influence on the cases. The proposed SSLPNN-based classification model performed well when predicting the classes of confirmed cases. During training, the binary classification model was highly accurate, with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.91. Likewise, the results of the regression analysis using the GPR technique with Matern 5/2 were highly accurate (RMSE = 0.95239) when predicting the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an area. However, dynamic management has occupied a core place in studies on the sustainable development of public health but dynamic management depends on proactive strategies based on statistically verified approaches, like Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this study, an SSLPNN model has been trained to fit public health associated data into an appropriate class, allowing GPR to predict the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in an area based on the given values of selected parameters. Therefore, this tool can help authorities in different ecological settings effectively manage COVID-19. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

The monitoring of any nutritional (phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium) deficiency in growing plants is a challenge for precision farming technology. A study was carried out on three species of popular crops, celery (Apium graveolens L., cv. Neon), sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L., cv. Tapir) and strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne, cv. Honeoye), fertilized with four different doses of phosphorus (P) to deliver data for non-invasive detection of P content. Results: Data obtained via biochemical analysis of the chlorophyll and carotenoid contents in plant material showed that the strongest effect of P availability for plants was in the diverse total chlorophyll content in sugar beet and celery compared to that in strawberry, in which P affects a variety of carotenoid contents in leaves. The measurements performed using hyperspectral imaging, obtained in several different stages of plant development, were applied in a supervised classification experiment. A machine learning algorithm (Backpropagation Neural Network, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and Support Vector Machine) was developed to classify plants from four variants of P fertilization. The lowest prediction accuracy was obtained for the earliest measured stage of plant development. Statistical analyses showed correlations between leaf biochemical constituents, phosphorus fertilization and the mass of the leaf/roots of the plants. Conclusions: Obtained results demonstrate that hyperspectral imaging combined with artificial intelligence methods has potential for non-invasive detection of non-homogenous phosphorus fertilization on crop levels. © 2021, The Author(s).','method',0,'P fertilization in precision farming','means','sustainably manage fertilizer for both economic and environmental ​reasons.','local','longitudinal','present','quantitative','Poland','hyperspectral images','Poland',0),('2-s2.0-85098951501','Climate change during the last 40 years has had a serious impact on agriculture and threatens global food and nutritional security. From over half a million plant species, cereals and legumes are the most important for food and nutritional security. Although systematic plant breeding has a relatively short history, conventional breeding coupled with advances in technology and crop management strategies has increased crop yields by 56 % globally between 1965−85, referred to as the Green Revolution. Nevertheless, increased demand for food, feed, fiber, and fuel necessitates the need to break existing yield barriers in many crop plants. In the first decade of the 21st century we witnessed rapid discovery, transformative technological development and declining costs of genomics technologies. In the second decade, the field turned towards making sense of the vast amount of genomic information and subsequently moved towards accurately predicting gene-to-phenotype associations and tailoring plants for climate resilience and global food security. In this review we focus on genomic resources, genome and germplasm sequencing, sequencing-based trait mapping, and genomics-assisted breeding approaches aimed at developing biotic stress resistant, abiotic stress tolerant and high nutrition varieties in six major cereals (rice, maize, wheat, barley, sorghum and pearl millet), and six major legumes (soybean, groundnut, cowpea, common bean, chickpea and pigeonpea). We further provide a perspective and way forward to use genomic breeding approaches including marker-assisted selection, marker-assisted backcrossing, haplotype based breeding and genomic prediction approaches coupled with machine learning and artificial intelligence, to speed breeding approaches.

We have employed unsupervised machine learning K-means clustering technique for exploring a big data that comprised of 88 attributes and 570 instances for better targeting of households that are in urgent need of welfare from the government. The clusters formed showed common patterns relating to insecurities in terms of loss of income and property, unemployment, disasters and disease etc. faced by households in each cluster. We found that households falling in rural areas jurisdictions face severe insecurities compared to other localities and are in urgent need of social protection interventions. We concluded that by employing K-means clustering unsupervised machine learning approach big data (even if it is limited) can be explored effectively for better targeting of social protection interventions for both developing and smart societies.

The new digitalization model is powered by the artificial intelligence (AI) technology. The integration of energy supply, demand, and renewable sources into the power grid will be controlled autonomously by smart software that optimizes decision-making and operations. AI will play an integral role in achieving this goal. This study focuses on the use of AI techniques in the energy sector. This study aims to present a realistic baseline that allows researchers and readers to compare their AI efforts, ambitions, new state-of-the-art applications, challenges, and global roles in policymaking. We covered three major aspects, including: i) the use of AI in solar and hydrogen power generation; (ii) the use of AI in supply and demand management control; and (iii) recent advances in AI technology. This study explored how AI techniques outperform traditional models in controllability, big data handling, cyberattack prevention, smart grid, IoT, robotics, energy efficiency optimization, predictive maintenance control, and computational efficiency. Big data, the development of a machine learning model, and AI will play an important role in the future energy market. Our study\'s findings show that AI is becoming a key enabler of a complex, new and data-related energy industry, providing a key magic tool to increase operational performance and efficiency in an increasingly cut-throat environment. As a result, the energy industry, utilities, power system operators, and independent power producers may need to focus more on AI technologies if they want meaningful results to remain competitive. New competitors, new business strategies, and a more active approach to customers would require informed and flexible regulatory engagement with the associated complexities of customer safety, privacy, and information security.

While their primary function is to capture and store water, they also have disproportionally large effects on biodiversity and biogeochemical cycling, with important relevance to several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the abundance and distribution of farm dams is unknown in most parts of the world. Therefore, we used artificial intelligence and remote sensing data to address this critical global information gap. Specifically, we trained a deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) on high‐definition satellite images to detect farm dams and carry out the first con-tinental‐scale assessment on density, distribution and historical trends. We found that in Australia there are 1.765 million farm dams that occupy an area larger than Rhode Island (4678 km2) and store over 20 times more water than Sydney Harbour (10,990 GL). The State of New South Wales recorded the highest number of farm dams (654,983; 37% of the total) and Victoria the highest overall density (1.73 dams km−2). We also estimated that 202,119 farm dams (11.5%) remain omitted from any maps, especially in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Three decades of historical records revealed an ongoing decrease in the construction rate of farm dams, from >3% per annum before 2000, to ~1% after 2000, to <0.05% after 2010—except in the Australian Capital Territory where rates have remained relatively high. We also found systematic trends in construction design: farm dams built in 2015 are on average 50% larger in surface area and contain 66% more water than those built in 1989. To facilitate sharing information on sustainable farm dam management with authorities, scientists, managers and local communities, we developed AusDams.org— a free interactive portal to visualise and generate statistics on the physical, environmental and ecological impacts of farm dams. © 2021 by the authors.

Modern imaging technologies enable the automatic visualization of multi-parameter for characterization of biological samples, reducing subjectivity and optimizing the analysis process. Furthermore, the combination of two or more imaging techniques has contributed to discovering new physicochemical tools and interpreting datasets in real time. Results: We present a new method for automatic characterization of seed quality based on the combination of multispectral and X-ray imaging technologies. We proposed an approach using X-ray images to investigate internal tissues because seed surface profile can be negatively affected, but without reaching important internal regions of seeds. An oilseed plant (Jatropha curcas) was used as a model species, which also serves as a multi-purposed crop of economic importance worldwide. Our studies included the application of a normalized canonical discriminant analyses (nCDA) algorithm as a supervised transformation building method to obtain spatial and spectral patterns on different seedlots. We developed classification models using reflectance data and X-ray classes based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The classification models, individually or combined, showed high accuracy (> 0.96) using reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data to predict quality traits such as normal seedlings, abnormal seedlings and dead seeds. Conclusions: Multispectral and X-ray imaging have a strong relationship with seed physiological performance. Reflectance at 940 nm and X-ray data can efficiently predict seed quality attributes.

However, solar energy accounts for only 2–4.6% of total energy utilization. Recently, in developed countries, various prediction models based on artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have been applied to predict solar radiation. In this study, one of the most recent AI algorithms, namely, boosted decision tree regression (BDTR) model, was applied to predict the changes in solar radiation based on collected data in Malaysia. The proposed model then compared with other conventional regression algorithms, such as linear regression and neural network. Two different normalization techniques (Gaussian normalizer binning normalizer), splitting size, and different input parameters were investigated to enhance the accuracy of the models. Sensitivity analysis and uncertainty analysis were introduced to validate the accuracy of the proposed model.

Design Group method of data handling-type artificial neural network (GMDH-type ANN) time series. Methods This study used an artificial intelligence time series (GMDH-type ANN) to forecast age-specific childhood mortality rates (neonatal and under-five) and sex-specific U5MR from 2018 to 2030. The data sets were the yearly historical mortality rates between 1960s and 2017, obtained from the World Bank website. Two scenarios of mortality trajectories were simulated: (1) status quo scenarios- A ssuming the current trend continues; and (2) acceleration scenarios-consistent with the SDG targets. Results At the projected rates of decline of 2.0% for NMR and 1.2% for U5MR, Nigeria will not achieve the child survival SDG targets by 2030. Unexpectedly, U5MR will begin to increase by 2028. To put Nigeria back on track, annual reduction rates of 7.8% for NMR and 10.7% for U5MR are required. Also, female U5MR is decreasing more slowly than male U5MR. At the end of SDG era, female deaths will be higher than male deaths (80.9 vs 62.6 deaths per 1000 live births). Conclusion Nigeria is not likely to achieve SDG targets for child survival and gender equities because female disadvantages will worsen. A plausible reason for the projected increase in female mortality is societal discrimination and victimisation faced by female child. Stakeholders in Nigeria need to adequately plan for child health to achieve SDG targets by 2030.

Also, sensitivity analysis is proposed to showcase the influence of uncertainties on the system and input parameters on the algorithm. The simulation results indicate that three improved versions of the global dynamic harmony search algorithm ﬁnd more promising results than the original algorithm, and confirm the superior accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the global dynamic harmony search-II. Also, reliability level and iteration values have a considerable impact on the total net annual cost of the optimal hybrid energy system based on wind and hydrogen energy. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC','study object',0,'optimisation of off-grid hybrid reneweable energy organization','means','buzzword','regional','longitudinal','past','quantitative','Iran','Iran Renewable Energy Organization','China',0),('2-s2.0-85102000803','The groundwater potential map is an important tool for a sustainable water management and land use planning, particularly for agricultural countries like Vietnam.

Recovery strategies such as remanufacturing enable durable parts and cores to be restored to their original functionality and performance, thereby minimising the consumption of virgin materials and energy required for the production of new parts and components. To date, the repair and restoration processes concerning those parts and cores that can be remanufactured involved conventional methods such as material overlay and welding. These conventional methods are highly dependent on skilled manual labour or specialised industrial robots. With the notable growth in the global remanufacturing industry, it is imperative to deploy highly-efficient and sustainable methods to automate repair and restoration. Recent trends in remanufacturing repair and restoration indicate an increasing interest in metal additive manufacturing technology. To enhance the additive manufacturing efficiency for automated repair and restoration, it is crucial to optimise the core design. This paper provides a comprehensive and comparative outline of remanufacturing repair and restoration, using both conventional and automated methods. This paper also presents and discusses comprehensive insight into the application of AI-based techniques for design optimisation specific to additive manufacturing repair. Component design optimisation is crucial due to its impact on process efficiency and the life cycle of components. The review indicates that, despite the increasing interest in using additive manufacturing for repair and restoration, reports on the application of AI for design optimisation specific to repair and restoration using additive manufacturing remain limited. Furthermore, there are no established guidelines concerning design for repair and restoration using additive manufacturing. The paper concludes with recommendations for further research and presents a future outlook on AI-based optimisation for component design to facilitate repair and restoration using additive manufacturing.

This paper addresses the hybridization of the micronuclear reactor and Renewable Energy Sources (RESs) Energy Sources (RESs) to develop a flexible, cost-effective, sustainable, and resilient off-grid Hybrid Energy System (HES). The paper presents three types of hybridization methods, termed ‘‘Direct Coupling,’’ ‘‘Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling,’’ and ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling.’’ The hybridization techniques are used to plan and identify the most efficient Nuclear-Renewable Micro-Hybrid Energy System (N-R MHES). The sizing, performance, and characterization of N-R MHES solely depend on the RES and load characteristics’ availability. Based on proposed hybridization techniques, mathematical modeling of N-R MHES’s economy is carried out in the MATLAB environment. An artificial intelligence optimization algorithm, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is used to minimize the Net Present Cost (NPC) and achieve the optimal system configurations of different N-R MHESs. The simulation results determine that ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple Products-based N-R MHES’’ provides around 1.8 times and 1.3 times lower NPC than ‘‘Single Resource and Multiple products-based Coupling’’ and ‘‘Multiple Resources and Multiple products-based Coupling,’’ respectively, with an acceptable margin of reliability.

This puts pressure on capture fishery as fish is a preferred protein source worldwide. However, the more resources we put into the capture fisheries to obtain maximum catch, the faster the fisheries stock becomes depleted. The best option left to produce enough fish to meet demand is relying on advanced aquaculture. Unfortunately, the impact of technological advancement in the aquaculture sector is not profound compared to the agricultural and manufacturing sectors. The advent of Cloud computing, Internet of Things, and Artificial Intelligence (CIA) has expanded numerous possibilities for applying and integrating information technology in all works of life. This article reviews the emergence of research development on CIA and the potential to revolutionize the aquaculture industry. The use of CIA techniques and tools such as drones, nano and micro-sensors, bionic robots, remote cameras, intelligent sorting, energy-saving processing equipment, statistical modules, and algorithms will reduce human intervention and increase aquaculture productivity. Also, the application of CIA in the aquaculture value chain to ensure effectiveness in traceability, feeding, disease detection, growth prediction, environmental monitoring, market information, and others is key to increasing aquaculture productivity and sustainability. Therefore, the future of aquaculture operations with less human labour, effective maintenance, and resource utilization largely depend on innovative technologies.

In addition, the meteorological data of the optimistic (RCP 4.5) and pessimistic (RCP 8.5) scenarios of three climate change models (EC-EARTH, HadGEM2-ES, and IPSL-CM5A-MR) until 2099 were obtained from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (hereafter CORDEX). According to projection data, it was predicted that the annual mean air temperature will increase between 1.7 and 3.3 °C. The average change in the precipitation will decrease between 10 and 33% during the sunflower growing seasons. It was calculated that it will increase from 9 to 25% in the winter wheat growing seasons. We calibrated grain yield using Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT). Performance indicators like Normalized Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) were calculated as 5.3% and 4.7% for sunflower; 7.9% and 6.3% for winter wheat, respectively.

The global population continues to grow and people are becoming wealthier, so the food production system must respond by creating enough high-quality food to feed everyone with minimal damage to our environment. The number of people suffering or dying from diet-related chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer, continues to rise, which is partly linked to overconsumption of highly processed foods, especially high-calorie or rapidly digestible foods. After falling for many years, the number of people suffering from starvation or malnutrition is rising, and thishas been exacerbated by the global COVID-19 pandemic. The highly integrated food supply chains that spread around the world are susceptible to disruptions due to policy changes, economic stresses, and natural disasters, as highlighted by the recent pandemic. In this perspective article, written by members of the Editorial Committee of the Annual Review of Food Science and Technology, we highlight some of the major challenges confronting the modern food supply chain as well as how innovations in policy and technology can be used to address them. Pertinent technological innovations include robotics, machine learning, artificial intelligence, advanced diagnostics, nanotechnology, biotechnology, gene editing, vertical farming, and soft matter physics. Many of these technologies are already being employed across the food chain by farmers, distributors, manufacturers, and consumers to improve the quality, nutrition, safety, and sustainability of the food supply. These innovations are required to stimulate the development and implementation of new technologies to ensure a more equitable, resilient, and efficient food production system. Where appropriate, these technologies should be carefully tested before widespread implementation so that proper risk-benefit analyses can be carried out. They can then be employed without causing unforeseen adverse consequences. Finally, it is important to actively engage all stakeholders involved in the food supply chain throughout the development and testing of these new technologies to support their adoption if proven safe and effective. © 2021 Annual Reviews Inc..

The novelty of the proposed system is presented to develop an efficient operation of monitoring drinking water to ensure a sustainable and friendly green environment. In this work, the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) algorithm was developed to predict the water quality index (WQI). Feed-forward neural network (FFNN) and K-nearest neighbors were applied to classify water quality. The dataset has eight significant parameters, but seven parameters were considered to show significant values. The proposed methodology was developed based on these statistical parameters. Prediction results demonstrated that the ANFIS model was superior for the prediction of WQI values. Nevertheless, the FFNN algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for water quality classification (WQC). Furthermore, the ANFIS model accurately predicted WQI, and the FFNN model showed superior robustness in classifying the WQC. In addition, the ANFIS model showed accuracy during the testing phase, with a regression coefficient of 96.17% for predicting WQI, and the FFNN model achieved the highest accuracy (100%) for WQC.

One concern in the injection molding industry is how to predict, and what affects, the quality of the molding products. While this is a large concern, prior studies have not yet examined such issues especially using machine learning techniques. The objective of this article, therefore, is to utilize several machine learning algorithms to test and compare their performances in quality prediction. Using several machine learning algorithms such as tree-based algorithms, regression-based algorithms, and autoencoder, we confirmed that machine learning models capture the complex relationship and that autoencoder outperforms comparing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Feature importance tests also revealed that temperature and time are influential factors that affect the quality.

At present, there are no clear guidelines of how monitoring vehicles must be configured for optimally tracking crop parameters at high resolution. This paper structures the architecture for such vehicles in four subsystems, examines the most common components for each subsystem, and delves into their interactions for an efficient delivery of high-density field data from initial acquisition to final recommendation. Its main advantages rest on the real time generation of crop maps that blend the global positioning of canopy location, some of their agronomical traits, and the precise monitoring of the ambient conditions surrounding such canopies. As a use case, the envisioned architecture was embodied in an autonomous robot to automatically sort two harvesting zones of a commercial vineyard to produce two wines of dissimilar characteristics. The information contained in the maps delivered by the robot may help growers systematically apply differential harvesting, evidencing the suitability of the proposed architecture for massive monitoring and subsequent data-driven actuation. While many crop parameters still cannot be measured non-invasively, the availability of novel sensors is continually growing; to benefit from them, an efficient and trustable sensing architecture becomes indispensable. © 2021 by the authors.

Both artificial intelligence (AI) and the internet of things (IoT) have become critical prerequisites to smart farming due to their high interoperability, sensors, and cutting-edge technologies. Extending the role of responsible leadership, this paper proposes an AI and IoT based smart farming system in Bangladesh. With a comprehensive literature review, this paper counsels the need to go beyond the simple application of traditional farming and irrigation practices and recommends implementing smart farming enabling responsible leadership to uphold sustainable agriculture. It contributes to the current literature of smart farming in several ways. First, this paper helps to understand the prospect and challenges of both AI and IoT and the requirement of smart farming in a nonwestern context. Second, it clarifies the interventions of responsible leadership into Bangladesh’s agriculture sector and justifies the demand for sustainable smart farming. Third, this paper is a step forward to explore future empirical studies for the effective and efficient use of AI and IoT to adopt smart farming.

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said — that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners — to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia’s position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches — planetary health, Indigenous people’s knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia’s direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing — most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media.

India being the largest consumer of groundwater in the world, dwindling groundwater storage has emerged as a serious concern in recent years. Consequently, the judicious and efficient management of vital groundwater resources is one of the grand challenges in India. Groundwater modeling is a promising tool to develop sustainable management strategies for the efficient utilization of this treasured resource. This study demonstrates a pragmatic framework for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at a large scale using real-world data. Three relatively powerful Machine Learning (ML) techniques viz., ANFIS (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System), Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) were employed for predicting seasonal groundwater levels at the country scale using in situ groundwater-level and pertinent meteorological data of 1996–2016. ANFIS, DNN and SVM models were developed for 18 Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZs) of India and their efficacy was evaluated using suitable statistical and graphical indicators. The findings of this study revealed that the DNN model is the most proficient in predicting seasonal groundwater levels in most AEZs, followed by the ANFIS model. However, the prediction ability of the three models is ‘moderate’ to ‘very poor’ in 3 AEZs [‘Western Plain and Kutch Peninsula’ in Western India, and ‘Deccan Plateau (Arid)’ and ‘Eastern Ghats and Deccan Plateau’ in Southern India].

This transformation is encouraged to reduce greenhouse gases using environmental-friendly practices. Although our country is rich in biomass resources due to climate, land conditions, agriculture and animal husbandry activities, the installed power is quite below its potential. Focusing on this point, the aim of this study is to propose a forecasting method that determines the quantities, distributions, production amounts, waste amounts and energy potential of various biomass resources consistently. The integrated method used in the solution utilizes statistical data and consists of artificial intelligence and geographic information systems. First of all, various bioenergy sources that can be used as energy resources have been determined, and the amount, yield, and energy potential of animal and agricultural wastes expected to occur in the following years have been estimated using an artificial intelligence-based method, support vector regression. Then, spatial analysis has been carried out using geographic information systems, and the distribution of existing and possible agricultural lands has been determined. Finally, the amount of energy that can be obtained using wastes from different biomass sources under various scenarios has been calculated and solutions have been compared. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first proposing an integrated method consisting of support vector regression and geographic information systems to forecast the biomass-based energy potential in Turkey. The integrated method was applied to Acıpayam district in Denizli. Among the various scenario approaches, the cultivation of rapeseed (canola) plants on non-utilized arable land and the use of its wastes in bioenergy production have been found to yield the highest energy potential. The results showed that approximately 29,2%, 27,8%, and 27,6% energy increase could be obtained from agricultural residues of rapeseed in the next three years if it was planted on the quarter of the idle land. Besides, under this scenario, the total annual electricity demand of 6972, 6663 and 6545 houses could be met from agricultural residues in a sustainable and clean manner.

Two input combination models, MLP-4-5-4 and MLP-4-9-4, were trained, verified, and tested for their predictive performance ability, and their physicochemical prediction accuracy was compared by using each model’s observed data with the predicted data. The MLP-4-5-4 model showed a better understanding of the data sets and water quality predictive ability giving an MSE of 39.06589 and a correlation coefficient (R2) of the observed and the predicted water quality of 0.989383 compared to the MLP-4-9-4 model (R2 = 0.993532, MSE = 39.03087).

Thus, the need for regular monitoring of coastal water quality is becoming increasingly vital, and remote sensing is deemed to be a viable approach particularly due to its cost-effectiveness. Over the past two decades, remote sensing using satellite imaging has already been adopted in various tasks related to the monitoring of coastal hydro-enviro nment, including the detection of oil spills, identification of turbid plumes, mapping of marine ecosystems, etc. Despite their usefulness, space-borne sensors are subjected to constraints such as low spatial resolution, clouds and atmospheric interference, sparse frequency, and inflexible scheduling. Recently, remote sensing with portable Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (pUAVs) is emerging as a promising alternative for high spatial-resolution monitoring of coastal hydro-environment, with the key advantages that they can minimize the effects of atmospheric disruptions and be implemented with a frequent schedule to perform on-demand monitoring. In addition, with the technological advances in the sensor\'s design, UAVs are now capable of capturing data with fine spectral resolutions, ranging from several (multispectral) to hundreds (hyperspectral) of spectral bands. Data analytic is also improving rapidly with the advancement in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning algorithms. In this paper, we present a systematic review of the recent developments in the utilization of UAV-based remote sensing for the sustainable development of the coastal hydro-environment, particularly with pUAVs. The key technical issues, including the design of UAV systems and the processing of data, are examined for specific applications.

This paper offers a novel sophisticated method for predicting solar irradiance (SIr) from environmental conditions. To this end, an efficient metaheuristic technique, namely electromagnetic field optimization (EFO), is employed for optimizing a neural network. This algorithm quickly mines a publicly available dataset for nonlinearly tuning the network parameters. To suggest an optimal configuration, five influential parameters of the EFO are optimized by an extensive trial and error practice. Analyzing the results showed that the proposed model can learn the SIr pattern and predict it for unseen conditions with high accuracy. Furthermore, it provided about 10% and 16% higher accuracy compared to two benchmark optimizers, namely shuffled complex evolution and shuffled frog leaping algorithm. Hence, the EFO-supervised neural network can be a promising tool for the early prediction of SIr in practice.

Scientists, however, still often struggle to understand how landscape characteristics contribute to deliver these intangible benefits, largely because it is hard to navigate how people value nature, and because there is a lack in methods that accommodate both comprehensive and time-efficient evaluations. Recent advances in technology and the proliferation of new data sources, such as social media data, open promising alternatives to traditional, resource-intensive methods, facilitating the understanding of the multiple relationships between people and nature. Here, we examine a user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI)-based approach for inferring visual-sensory landscape values from Flickr data, combining computer vision with text mining. We show it is possible to automatically relate photographers\' preferences in capturing landscape elements to a set of CESs (aesthetic value, outdoor recreation, cultural heritage, symbolic species) with reasonable accuracy, using the semantic content provided by approximately 640,000 artificially generated tags of photographs taken in the UNESCO world heritage site ‘The Dolomites’ (Italy). We used the geographic information in the data to demonstrate that these preferences can be further linked to different natural and human variables and be used to spatially predict CES patterns. Over 90% of photograph tags could be linked to four CES categories with reasonable confidence (accuracy ration ∼ 80%). The Dolomites are highly appreciated for its aesthetic value (66% of images classified to that category) and vast cultural heritage (13%), followed by its outdoor recreation opportunities (11%) and symbolic species (10%). CES benefiting hotspots were found in areas with high tourism development and close to residential areas, and could largely be explained by a combination of environmental (e.g. landscape composition) and infrastructural (e.g. accessibility) variables. We conclude that online available AI technology and social media data can effectively be used to support rapid, flexible and transferrable CES assessments. Our work can provide a reference for innovative adaptive management approaches that can harness emerging technologies to gain insights into human–nature relationships and to sustainably manage our environment.

In this paper, the design of a Neural Network (NN)-based prediction model of a greenhouse’s internal air temperature, to be deployed and run on an edge device with constrained capabilities, is investigated. The model relies on a time series-oriented approach, taking as input variables the past and present values of the air temperature to forecast the future ones. In detail, we evaluate three different NN architecture types—namely, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Recurrent NNs (RNNs) and Artificial NNs (ANNs)—with various values of the sliding window associated with input data. Experimental results show that the three best-performing models have a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) value in the range 0.289 ÷ 0.402 °C, a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) in the range of 0.87 ÷ 1.04%, and a coefficient of determination (R2) not smaller than 0.997. The overall best performing model, based on an ANN, has a good prediction performance together with low computational and architectural complexities (evaluated on the basis of the NetScore metric), making its deployment on an edge device feasible. © 2021 by the authors.

The quality of water resources depends on the effectiveness of water treatment plants to reduce chemical pollutants, such as nitrates, pharmaceuticals, or microplastics. Changes in water quality can vary rapidly and must be monitored in real-time, enabling immediate action. In this study, we test the feasibility of a deep UV Raman spectrometer for the detection of nitrate/nitrite, selected pharmaceuticals and the most widespread microplastic polymers. Software utilizing artificial intelligence, such as a convolutional neural network, is trained for recognizing typical spectral patterns of individual pollutants, once processed by mathematical filters and machine learning algorithms. The results of an initial experimental study show that nitrates and nitrites can be detected and quantified. The detection of nitrates poses some challenges due to the noise-to-signal ratio and background and related noise due to water or other materials. Selected pharmaceutical substances could be detected via Raman spectroscopy, but not at concentrations in the µg/l or ng/l range. Microplastic particles are non-soluble substances and can be detected and identified, but the measurements suffer from the heterogeneous distribution of the microparticles in flow experiments. © 2021 by the authors.

However, to date, very few studies have investigated which digital technologies could enable the circular economy in the built environment. This study specifically focuses on the built environment as one of the largest, most energy- and material-intensive industries globally, and investigates the following question: which digital technologies potentially enable a circular economy in the built environment, and in what ways? The research uses an iterative stepwise method: (1) framework development based on regenerating, narrowing, slowing and closing resource loop principles; (2) expert workshops to understand the usage of digital technologies in a circular built environment; (3) a literature and practice review to further populate the emerging framework with relevant digital technologies; and (4) the final mapping of digital technologies onto the framework. This study develops a novel Circular Digital Built Environment framework. It identifies and maps ten enabling digital technologies to facilitate a circular economy in the built environment.

Likewise, to meet the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially the second goal of “zero hunger”, potential technologies like remote sensing (RS) need to be efficiently integrated into agriculture. The application of RS is indispensable today for a highly productive and sustainable agriculture. Therefore, the present study draws a general overview of RS technology with a special focus on the principal platforms of this technology, i.e., satellites and remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), and the sensors used, in relation to the 5th industrial revolution. Nevertheless, since 1957, RS technology has found applications, through the use of satellite imagery, in agriculture, which was later enriched by the incorporation of remotely piloted aircrafts (RPAs), which is further pushing the boundaries of proficiency through the upgrading of sensors capable of higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolutions. More prominently, wireless sensor technologies (WST) have streamlined real time information acquisition and programming for respective measures. Improved algorithms and sensors can, not only add significant value to crop data acquisition, but can also devise simulations on yield, harvesting and irrigation periods, metrological data, etc., by making use of cloud computing. The RS technology generates huge sets of data that necessitate the incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data to extract useful products, thereby augmenting the adeptness and efficiency of agriculture to ensure its sustainability. These technologies have made the orientation of current research towards the estimation of plant physiological traits rather than the structural parameters possible. Futuristic approaches for benefiting from these cutting-edge technologies are discussed in this study.

Support vector machines (SVM) for regression with Bayesian optimization is used to determine the tool wear based on various machining parameters. A coated insert carbide tool 2025 was utilized in turning tests of 709M40 alloy steel. Experimental data were collected for three machining parameters like feed rate, depth of cut, and cutting speed, while the parameter of tool wear was calculated with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The SVM model was trained on 162 experimental data points and the trained model was then used to estimate the experimental testing data points to determine the model performance. The proposed SVM model with Bayesian optimization achieved a superior accuracy in estimation of the tool wear with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 6.13% and root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.29%. The results suggest the feasibility of adopting artificial intelligence methods in estimating the machining parameters to reduce the time and costs of manufacturing processes and contribute toward greater sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

The distinguished features of artificial intelligence (AI) based modeling can deliver a deep insight pertaining to rising water quality concerns. The current study investigates the predictive performance of gene expression programming (GEP), artificial neural network (ANN) and linear regression model (LRM) for modeling monthly total dissolved solids (TDS) and specific conductivity (EC) in the upper Indus River at two outlet stations. In total, 30 years of historical water quality data, comprising 360 TDS and EC monthly records, were used for models training and testing. Based on a significant correlation, the TDS and EC modeling were correlated with seven input parameters. Results were evaluated using various performance measure indicators, error assessment and external criteria. The simulated outcome of the models indicated a strong association with actual data where the correlation coefficient above 0.9 was observed for both TDS and EC. Both the GEP and ANN models remained the reliable techniques in predicting TDS and EC. The formulated GEP mathematical equations depict its novelty as compared to ANN and LRM. The results of sensitivity analysis indicated the increasing trend of input variables affecting TDS as HCO3− (22.33%) > Cl− (21.66%) > Mg2+ (16.98%) > Na+ (14.55%) > Ca2+ (12.92%) > SO4 2− (11.55%) > pH (0%), while, in the case of EC, it followed the trend as HCO3− (42.36%) > SO4 2−(25.63%) > Ca2+ (13.59%) > Cl− (12.8%) > Na+ (5.01%) > pH (0.61%) > Mg2+ (0%). The parametric analysis revealed that models have incorporated the effect of all the input parameters in the modeling process. The external assessment criteria confirmed the generalized outcome and robustness of the proposed approaches. Conclusively, the outcomes of this study demonstrated that the formulation of AI based models are cost effective and helpful for river water quality assessment, management and policy making. © 2021 by the authors.

An accurate wind power forecasting is crucial to achieve a stable and reliable operation of the power grid. However, the unpredictability and stochastic characteristics of wind power affect the grid planning and operation adversely. To address these concerns, a substantial amount of research has been carried out to introduce an efficient wind power forecasting approach. Artificial Intelligence (AI) approaches have demonstrated high precision, better generalization performance and improved learning capability, thus can be ideal to handle unstable, inflexible and intermittent wind power. Recently, AI-based hybrid approaches have become popular due to their high precision, strong adaptability and improved performance. Thus, the goal of this review paper is to present the recent progress of AI-enabled hybrid approaches for wind power forecasting emphasizing classification, structure, strength, weakness and performance analysis. Moreover, this review explores the various influential factors toward the implementations of AI-based hybrid wind power forecasting including data preprocessing, feature selection, hyperparameters adjustment, training algorithm, activation functions and evaluation process.

AI is expected to impact on healthcare processes and could contribute to a more sustainable use of resources allocated to healthcare in the future. The aim for this work was to establish a foundation for a Swedish perspective on the potential effect of AI on the medical physics profession. Materials and methods: We designed a survey to gauge viewpoints regarding AI in the Swedish medical physics community. Based on the survey results and present-day situation in Sweden, a SWOT analysis was performed on the implications of AI for the medical physics profession. Results: Out of 411 survey recipients, 163 responded (40%). The Swedish medical physicists with a professional license believed (90%) that AI would change the practice of medical physics but did not foresee (81%) that AI would pose a risk to their practice and career. The respondents were largely positive to the inclusion of AI in educational programmes. According to self-assessment, the respondents’ knowledge of and workplace preparedness for AI was generally low. Conclusions: From the survey and SWOT analysis we conclude that AI will change the medical physics profession and that there are opportunities for the profession associated with the adoption of AI in healthcare. To overcome the weakness of limited AI knowledge, potentially threatening the role of medical physicists, and build upon the strong position in Swedish healthcare, medical physics education and training should include learning objectives on AI. © 2021 Associazione Italiana di Fisica Medica','study object',0,'opinions of medical professionals on AI','means',NULL,'national','snapshot','present','qualitative','Sweden','questionnaire','Sweden',0),('2-s2.0-85111035853','Deep learning; Dimensionality reduction; Disasters; Drones; Edge computing; Image processing; Internet of things; Pipeline processing systems; Pipelines; Program processors; Amount of information; Clustering procedure; Computational workload; Computing platform; Environmental footprints; Experimental evaluation; Internet of Things (IOT); Real time tracking; Climate change','method',0,'Reducing drone information through AI sorting in climate crisis situations','end',NULL,NULL,'snapshot','present','quantitative',NULL,'artificial dataset','Spain',0),('2-s2.0-85111066768','Bioenergy may be a major replacement of fossil fuels which can make the path easier for sustainable development and decrease the dependency on conventional sources of energy.

Historically, developing human civilizations have often settled in coastal areas with about 2/3 of the human population inhabiting areas within 20-km range from coastal areas. Environmental management worldwide strives for sustainable development while minimizing impacts to ecosystem integrity and has resulted in several framework directives, management programs, and legislation compelling governments to monitor their coastal systems and improve environmental quality. Among the most significant anthropogenic impacts to these ecosystems are land reclamation, dredging, pollution (sediment discharges, hazardous substances, litter, oil spills, and eutrophication), unsustainable exploitation of marine resources (sand extraction, oil and gas exploitation, and fishing), unmanaged tourism activities, the introduction of non-indigenous species, and climate change. The multitude of stressors is not independent, and as such, the chemical status of marine systems has serious implications on its ecological status and needs to be addressed efficiently. Public monitoring databases provide a large amount of physico-chemical (nutrient, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll a concentration) and contaminant (trace metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) data for all Portuguese transitional systems (estuaries and coastal lagoons). These data are used to classify the chemical status (eutrophication and contamination level) of these ecosystems considering pre-defined classification thresholds, which facilitates communication to government authorities and management entities. Artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques provide an automated and efficient opportunity to improve simulation accuracy and further advance our understanding of environmental problems in estuarine and coastal waters when dealing with large environmental datasets. In the present work, we applied machine learning models, namely, linear discriminant analysis, classification tree, naive Bayesian, and support vector machine, to nutrient, dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, trace metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations to produce a chemical status classification of the Portuguese marine transition systems. This approach allowed us to efficiently classify in an automated way the transitional water’s chemical status within the pre-defined classification thresholds, producing numerical index values that can easily be communicated to the general public and managers alike. © Copyright © 2021 Concepcion, Dadios, Bandala, Caçador, Fonseca and Duarte.','method',0,'classification of water quality with machine learning techniques','means',NULL,'national','snapshot','present','quantitative','Portugal','water and sediment samples from the coast of Portugal','Portugal',0),('2-s2.0-85111673817','Background/purpose – Education in the 21st century faces a series of challenges, including training in mobile and ubiquitous contexts, and the improvement of the didactic processes associated with online and face-to-face teaching.

The aim of this study was to predict maize yields using AI that uses spatio-temporal training data. The paper has advanced a new method of maize yield prediction, which is based on spatio-temporal data mining. To find the best solution, various models were used: counter-propagation artificial neural networks (CP-ANNs), XY-fused Querynetworks (XY-Fs), supervised Kohonen networks (SKNs), neural networks with Rectangular Linear Activations (ReLU), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support-vector machine (SVM), and different subsets of the independent variables in five vegetation periods. Input variables for modelling included: soil parameters (pH, P2O5, K2O, Zn, clay content, ECa, draught force, Cone index), micro-relief averages, and meteorological parameters for the 63 treatment units in a 15.3 ha research field. The best performing method (XGBoost) reached 92.1% and 95.3% accuracy on the training and the test sets. Additionally, a novel method was introduced to treat individual units in a lattice system. The lattice-based smoothing performed an additional increase in Area under the curve (AUC) to 97.5% over the individual predictions of the XGBoost model. The models were developed using 48 different subsets of variables to determine which variables consistently contributed to prediction accuracy. By comparing the resulting models, it was shown that the best regression model was Extreme Gradient Boosting Trees, with 92.1% accuracy (on the training set). In addition, the method calculates the influence of the spatial distribution of site-specific soil fertility on maize grain yields.

From a basis of “one-size-fits-all” healthcare, precision medicine provides a paradigm shift to deliver a more nuanced and personalized approach. Genomic medicine utilizing new technologies can provide precision analysis of causative mutations, with personalized understanding of mechanisms and effective therapy. Education is fundamental to the telehealth process, with artificial intelligence (AI) enhancing learning for healthcare professionals and empowering patients to contribute to their care.

Alternatively, waste to energy (WTE) systems have been recently adopted to provide sustainable waste management and diversify the energy mix. The abundance of remotely sensed datasets and derivatives, along with the rapid development of artificial intelligence, can offer an effective solution for WTE site selection. In this study, an analytical hierarchy process (AHP)-based framework supported by multiple machine learning algorithms (gradient boosted tree (GBT), decision tree (DT), and support vector machines (SVMs)) was established to explore the optimum location for WTE facilities. Various social, legal, environmental, economic, morphological, and land cover parameters were considered under 11 thematic geospatial raster layers. The proposed framework was applied to the 1.5-million-capita city of Sharjah, United Arab Emirates. A novel approach was developed to incorporate Gaussian dispersion modeling for the expected air pollution emissions from a WTE facility. The results showed that the accuracy performance sequence of the algorithms was 94.6, 93.9, and 91.8% for GBT, DT, and SVM, respectively. It was found that the distance from existing landfills had the most critical impact on the optimum location of the WTE facility, followed by the distance from coastline and elevation.

It helps to implement, improve, and add new attributes to healthcare services. The paper aims to develop a method based on an artificial neural network technique to predict suspicious devices based on bandwidth usage. Background COVID has made it mandatory to make medical services available online to every remote place. However, services in the healthcare ecosystem require fast, uninterrupted facilities while securing the data flowing through them. The solution in this paper addresses both the security and uninterrupted services issue. This paper proposes a neural network based solution to detect and disable suspicious devices without interrupting critical and life-saving services. Methodology This paper is an advancement on our previous research, where we performed manual knowledge-based intrusion detection. In this research, all the experiments were executed in the healthcare domain. The mobility pattern of the devices was divided into six parts, and each one is assigned a dedicated slice. The security module regularly monitored all the clients connected to slices, and machine learning was used to detect and disable the problematic or suspicious devices. We have used MATLAB’s neural network to train the dataset and automatically detect and disable suspicious devices. The different network architectures and different training algorithms (Levenberg–Marquardt and Bayesian Framework) in MATLAB software have attempted to achieve more precise values with different properties. Five iterations of training were executed and compared to get the best result of R=99971. We configured the application to handle the four most applicable use cases. We also performed an experimental application simulation for the assessment and validation of predictions. Contribution This paper provides a security solution for the IoT enabled healthcare system. The architectures discussed suggest an end-to-end solution on the sliced network. Efficient use of artificial neural networks detects and block suspicious devices. Moreover, the solution can be modified, configured and deployed in many other ecosystems like home automation. Findings This simulation is a subset of the more extensive simulation previously performed on the sliced network to enhance its security. This paper trained the data using a neural network to make the application intelligent and robust. This enhancement helps detect suspicious devices and isolate them before any harm is caused on the network. The solution works both for an intrusion detection and prevention system by detecting and blocking them from using network resources. The result concludes that using multiple hidden layers and a non-linear transfer function, logsig improved the learning and results. Recommendations Everything from offices, schools, colleges, and e-consultation is currently for Practitioners happening remotely. It has caused extensive pressure on the network where the data flowing through it has increased multifold. Therefore, it becomes our joint responsibility to provide a cost-effective and sustainable security solution for IoT enabled healthcare services. Practitioners can efficiently use this affordable solution compared to the expensive security options available in the commercial market and deploy it over a sliced network. The solution can be implemented by NGOs and federal governments to provide secure and affordable healthcare monitoring services to patients in remote locations. Recommendations Research can take this solution to the next level by integrating artificial intellifor Researchers gence into all the modules. They can augment this solution by making it compatible with the federal government’s data privacy laws. Authentication and encryption modules can be integrated to enhance it further. Impact on Society COVID has given massive exposure to the healthcare sector since last year. With everything online, data security and privacy is the next most significant concern. This research can be of great support to those working for the security of health care services. This paper provides “Security as a Solution”, which can enhance the security of an otherwise less secure ecosystem. The healthcare use cases discussed in this paper address the most common security issues in the IoT enabled healthcare ecosystem. Future Research We can enhance this application by including data privacy modules like authentication and authorisation, data encryption and help to abide by the federal privacy laws. In addition, machine learning and artificial intelligence can be extended to other modules of this application. Moreover, this experiment can be easily applicable to many other domains like e-homes, e-offices and many others. For example, e-homes can have devices like kitchen equipment, rooms, dining, cars, bicycles, and smartwatches. Therefore, one can use this application to monitor these devices and detect any suspicious activity. © 2021 Informing Science Institute.

This work combines dynamic pricing and information disclosure to help retailers to effectively sell fresh produce and promote sustainability. We focus on a quality-based pricing strategy and whether retailers should disclose information on food quality to customers. We consider a model where a monopolistic retailer sells fresh produce to customers who have different perceptions about food quality within a given time period. We employ a deep reinforcement learning algorithm to derive the optimal pricing and information strategies. Our simulation results show that a quality-based pricing strategy yields lower prices than a pricing strategy that does not consider quality. Lower prices drive demand, thus improving profits and reducing food waste. Additionally, we show that, when an information strategy is allowed, the prices in a quality-based pricing strategy stay the same or even increase during the selling season. This is because information disclosure helps align customers’ biased perceptions on food quality with the actual levels. We show that a combination of quality-based pricing and information disclosure further improves profits and reduces food waste when a large portion of customers consider quality to be lower than actual levels. To implement our ideas, we propose a cloud-based automated system that integrates sensor data, artificial intelligence, and customer communications.

The simplified approach of river health assessment involves computation of water quality index (WQI). In this study, WQI calculation is based on six water quality variables (i.e., dissolved oxygen in % saturation (DO% sat), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD-Cr), pH, suspended solids (SS), and ammoniacal nitrogen (NH3-N)). This study introduces H2O deep learning (DL), random forest (RF), and decision tree (DT) classification models for WQI based on two investigated modeling scenarios—S-I and S-II. S-I uses a Klang River dataset from five monitoring sites representing a “small-scale catchment”; S-II uses a Klang River Basin dataset from 19 stations representing a “large-scale catchment”. In both scenarios, H2O DL model demonstrated excellent outcome and RF performed rather better in S-I, in terms of model performance accuracy as well as classification error. In S-I/S-II, the accuracy for H2O DL was 88.6%/87.8%, RF 89%/84%, and DT 83%/77%; moreover, in terms of classification error for S-I/S-II, H2O DL 11.3%/12%, RF 10.8%/16%, and DT 14%/22%. H2O DL showed excellent performance when dealing with nonlinear, non-stationary, and varying number of WQ data, and it was followed by the RF model. This study highlights the application of the novel H2O DL and RF models for prediction of river WQI classes. The classification based on WQI for small catchment is simple, fast, cost-effective, and beneficial for river WQ assessment, management, and policy-making. Nonetheless, for a large catchment hydrological dataset, it is yet to be improved using specific function of AI algorithm. © 2021, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.','study object',0,'Prediction of Water Quality Index Classification','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','future','quantitative','Malaysia','Klang River dataset from five monitoring sites; Klang River Basin dataset from 19 stations','Vietnam',0),('2-s2.0-85112649952','Air pollution; Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision making; Decision support systems; Forestry; Heavy metals; Predictive analytics; Sustainable development; Water pollution; Accurate analysis; Artificial intelligence techniques; Environmental decision making; Environmental pollutions; Environmental prediction; Heavy metal concentration; Mangrove ecosystems; Predictive modeling; Ecosystems','study object',0,'AI used in DSS for Mangrove ecosystem management','end',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Malaysia',0),('2-s2.0-85112863652','Agriculture is a vital area for the sustenance of mankind engulfing manufacturing, security, traceability, and sustainable resource management.

Paradoxically, IoT technologies and paradigms such as edge computing, although they have a huge potential for the digital transition towards sustainability, they are not yet contributing to the sustainable development of the IoT sector itself. In fact, such a sector has a significant carbon footprint due to the use of scarce raw materials and its energy consumption in manufacturing, operating, and recycling processes. To tackle these issues, the Green IoT (G-IoT) paradigm has emerged as a research area to reduce such carbon footprint; however, its sustainable vision collides directly with the advent of Edge Artificial Intelligence (Edge AI), which imposes the consumption of additional energy. This article deals with this problem by exploring the different aspects that impact the design and development of Edge-AI G-IoT systems. Moreover, it presents a practical Industry 5.0 use case that illustrates the different concepts analyzed throughout the article. Specifically, the proposed scenario consists in an Industry 5.0 smart workshop that looks for improving operator safety and operation tracking. Such an application case makes use of a mist computing architecture composed of AI-enabled IoT nodes. After describing the application case, it is evaluated its energy consumption and it is analyzed the impact on the carbon footprint that it may have on different countries.

New algorithms for producing reliable data and the addition of other sources of information (e.g., novel sensors) will enhance flow of information between ML and systems. It is expected that unsupervised and reinforcement learning will take a central role in the energy sector, but this will depend on the expansion of other major fields in data science such as big data analytics.

However, detecting and localization leakage in a WDN remains a challenging technical problem despite of significant progresses in this domain. The progresses in machine learning (ML) provides new ways to identify the leakage by data-driven methods. However, in-service WDNs are short of labeled data under leaking conditions, which makes it infeasible to use common ML models. This study proposed a novel machine learning (ML)-based framework for WDN leak detection and localization. This new framework, named clustering-then-localization semi-supervised learning (CtL-SSL), uses the topological relationship of WDN and its leakage characteristics for WDN partition and sensors placement, and subsequently utilizes the monitoring data for leakage detection and leakage localization. The CtL-SSL framework is applied to two testbed WDNs and achieves 95% leakage detection accuracy and around 83% final leakage localization accuracy by use of unbalanced data with less than 10% leaking data. The developed CtL-SSL framework advances the leak detection strategy by alleviating the data requirements, guiding optimal sensor placement, and locating leakage via WDN leakage zone partition. It features excellent scalability, extensibility, and upgradeability for applications to various types of WDNs.

Now is the right time for constructive approaches and to apply ethics-by-design in order to develop and implement a safe and efficient artificial intelligence (AI) application. So far, no study has addressed the key research question: Where can corporate digital responsibility (CDR) be allocated, and how shall an adequate ethical framework be designed to support digital innovations in order to make full use of the potentials of digitization and AI? Therefore, the research on how best practices meet their corporate responsibility in the digital transformation process and the requirements of the EU for trustworthy AI and its human-friendly use is essential. Its transformation bears a high potential for companies, is critical for success and thus, requires responsible handling. This study generates data by conducting case studies and interviewing experts as part of the qualitative method to win profound insights into applied practice. It provides an assessment of demands stated in the Sustainable Development Goals by the United Nations (SDGs), White Papers on AI by international institutions, European Commission and German Government requesting the consideration and protection of values and fundamental rights, the careful demarcation between machine (artificial) and human intelligence and the careful use of such technologies. The study discusses digitization and the impacts of AI in construction engineering from an ethical perspective. This research critically evaluates opportunities and risks concerning CDR in construction industry. To the author’s knowledge, no study has set out to investigate how CDR in construction could be conceptualized, especially in relation to digitization and AI, to mitigate digital transformation both in large, medium- and small-sized companies. This study applies a holistic, interdisciplinary, inclusive approach to provide guidelines for orientation and examine benefits as well as risks of AI. Furthermore, the goal is to define ethical principles which are key for success, resource-cost-time efficiency and sustainability using digital technologies and AI in construction engineering to enhance digital transformation.

Health coaching has been shown to be an effective approach for improving behavioral changes in self-management. Health coaching combined with telehealth technology has the potential to improve the overall quality of and access to health services. Objective: This protocol outlines the study design for implementing the Artificial Intelligence for Diabetes Management (AI4DM) intervention. The protocol will assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of the AI4DM telehealth platform for people with disabilities. Methods: The AI4DM study is a 2-arm randomized controlled trial for evaluating the delivery of a 12-month intervention, which will involve telecoaching, diabetes educational content, and technology access, to 90 individuals with diabetes and physical disabilities. The hypothesis is that this pilot project is feasible and acceptable for adults with permanently impaired mobility and type 2 diabetes. We also hypothesize that adults in the AI4DM intervention groups will have significantly better glycemic control (glycated hemoglobin) and psychosocial and psychological measures than the attention control group at the 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups. Results: The AI4DM study was approved by the university\'s institutional review board, and recruitment and enrollment will begin in October 2021.

To achieve the research objective, geospatial artificial intelligence approaches such as the self-organizing map (SOM), artificial neural network (ANN), and co-active neuro-fuzzy inference system (CANFIS) were used to simulate groundwater quality in the Mazandaran plain in the north of Iran. Geographical information system (GIS) techniques were used as a pre-processer and post-processer. Data from 85 drinking water wells was used as secondary data and were separated into two splits of (a) 70 percent for training (60% for training and 10% for cross-validation), and (b) 30 percent for the test stage. The groundwater quality index (GWQI) and the effective water quality factors (distance from industries, groundwater depth, and transmissivity of aquifer formations) were implemented as output and input variables, respectively. Statistical indices (i.e., R squared (R-sqr) and the mean squared error (MSE)) were utilized to compare the performance of three methods. The results demonstrate the high performance of the three methods in groundwater quality simulation. However, in the test stage, CANFIS (R-sqr = 0.89) had a higher performance than the SOM (R-sqr = 0.8) and ANN (R-sqr = 0.73) methods. The tested CANFIS model was used to estimate GWQI values on the area of the plain. Finally, the groundwater quality was mapped in a GIS environment associated with CANFIS simulation.

The main contribution of this work is the unique methodology, which starts with a sizing procedure of various hybrid energy systems using a commercial software “Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER)” and spreadsheet algorithms, followed by a “Non-dominating Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II)” based multiobjective optimization. Single-objective optimization scenarios contain photovoltaic installation capacity, wind turbines, diesel generators, and battery energy storage systems including Pb-acid (Lead-acid), Li-ion (Lithium-ion), and AGM (Absorbent Glass Mat) technologies as design variables to maximize the cost of electricity or net-present-cost. Multiobjective optimization also involved environmental (CO2 emissions i.e. carbon dioxide emissions) and water cost indices as an additional packet to single-objective optimization scenarios. Afterward, a multicriteria decision-making tool using “The Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)” is applied on the Pareto front to attain the final optimization results. The analysis is further explored in depth by generating digital twins (surrogate or meta model) of HRES data using artificial intelligence techniques (artificial neural network and group-method-of-data-handling). Furthermore, calculus and statistical sensitivity analysis assist in the identification of the significant variables in the design procedure. In summary, the technical contribution of this work can be divided into two sections. The first one is the design of a hybrid energy system for the water management of an isolated community of the indigenous Mayan region of Yucatan, Mexico, which has never been considered before. Secondly, the technical contribution is related to the usage of environmental emissions as an objective function, which is not considered in the traditional design of hybrid energy systems by the software HOMER. Environmental emission as an objective function is not considered while designing a hybrid energy system in commerical softwares like HOMER, in fact, HOMER provides a list of environmental impacts but it is a secondary outcome as a result of technoeconomic optimization. Analysis of results between HOMER pro and spreadsheet has shown conformity, reporting that the optimal case consists of a photovoltaic system, diesel generator, and Li-ion technology of battery storage with capacities of ∼17 kW, ∼5kW, and 44–48 kWh, respectively, corresponding to a net present cost ranging from 70,000 United States Dollars (USD) to 79,000 USD and a cost of electricity ranging from 0.205 to 0.229 USD/kWh. The achievements obtained with multiobjective optimization indicate that the cost of electricity and net present cost can be further reduced by 0.86 % and 0.73 %, respectively, at a decrement of only 0.4% of the renewable fraction as compared to the single objective optimization scenario. It is concluded that multiobjective optimization provides an add-in feature to HOMER by using environmental emissions as an objective function. The design procedure and adapted methodology can be useful to promote sustainable development in the statewide context and can provide a scientific justification to national energy policymakers. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd','method',0,'address the national problems in Mexico related to water management, water security, and water rights, as well as mitigation and adaptation to climate change','means','SDGs','local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Mexico','The dataset used in the study is generated using HOMER, with specific tuning parameters for PV capacity, generator capacity, battery storage capacity, and inverter capacity','Mexico',0),('2-s2.0-85115602271','The project aims to create a Greenhouse Industry 4.0 Digital Twin software platform for combining the Industry 4.0 technologies (IoT, AI, Big Data, cloud computing, and Digital Twins) as integrated parts of the greenhouse production systems. The integration provides a new disruptive approach for vertical integration and optimization of the greenhouse production processes to improve energy efficiency, production throughput, and productivity without compromising product quality or sustainability. Applying the Industry 4.0 Digital Twin concept to the Danish horticulture greenhouse industry provides digital models for simulating and evaluating the physical greenhouse facility’s performance. A Digital Twin combines modeling, AI, and Big Data analytics with IoT and traditional sensor data from the production and cloud-based enterprise data to predict how the physical twin will perform under varying operational conditions. The Digital Twins support the co-optimization of the production schedule, energy consumption, and labor cost by considering influential factors, including production deadlines, quality grading, heating, artificial lighting, energy prices (gas and electricity), and weather forecasts. The ecosystem of digital twins extends the state-of-the-art by adopting a scalable distributed approach of “system of systems” that interconnects Digital Twins in a production facility. A collection of specialized Digital Twins are linked together to describe and simulate all aspects of the production chain, such as overall production capacity, energy consumption, delivery dates, and supply processes. The contribution of this project is to develop an ecosystem of digital twins that collectively capture the behavior of an industrial greenhouse facility. The ecosystem will enable the industrial greenhouse facilities to become increasingly active participants in the electricity grid. © 2021, The Author(s).','both',0,'Greenhouse Industry 4.0 Digital Twin','means','energy-efficient and environmentally sustainable','national','snapshot','present','quantitative','Denmark','greenhouse production-based sensor data;cloud-based enterprise data','Denmark',0),('2-s2.0-85115752770','Great advancements in technologies such as big data analytics, robots, remote sensing, the Internet of Things, decision support systems and artificial intelligence have transformed the agricultural sector. In the greenhouse sector, these technologies help farmers increase their profits and crop yields while minimizing the production costs, produce in a more environmentally friendly way and mitigate the risks caused by climate change. In greenhouse farming, especially in the Mediterranean region, a lack of knowledge and qualified personnel able to uptake new knowledge, the small size of farms, etc., make it difficult to implement new technologies. Although it is necessary to demonstrate the advantages of innovations related to sustainable agriculture, there is a little opportunity for specific training on greenhouse production in cutting-edge technologies. To gain insight into this problem, questionnaires for greenhouse farmers and intermediaries were developed in multiple choice format and filled in by the stakeholders. A statistical analysis was performed, and the results are presented in graphical form. In most cases, the findings confirmed that producers who run small farms, in most cases, have a lack of knowledge, especially on how to manage climate control systems or fertigation systems. The majority of farmers were elderly with a low level of education, which makes it difficult to be aware of the training issues, due to distrust and a lack of innovation culture. Therefore, their strategy was usually survival with cost control. However, young graduates have been recently returning to agriculture, and they are open to training activities and innovation. The most desirable training offer should be related to sustainable agriculture and precision agriculture technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

The study mainly focuses on (1) the development and use of AI systems/projects reported by companies, (2) the extent to which companies disclose ethical principles or guidelines regarding AI and (3) the factors explaining these practices. The study analyses the reports of 200 companies listed in the major indexes of Germany, Sweden, Finland, France, Spain, and Italy, both from qualitative and quantitative perspectives. All reports are analysed, using content analysis methodology, to identify expressions such as ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘machine learning’, ‘deep learning’, and ‘big data’, and then classified accordingly. The study\'s findings suggest a growing interest in the above-mentioned technologies, although 41.5% of companies do not report any activity in the field of AI. The adoption of ethical approaches to AI is at a very preliminary stage, and<5% of companies report on that issue. The quantitative analysis shows that larger companies, companies in the Technology and Telecommunications industries, and companies based in Southern countries are more likely to disclose information on AI activity. The majority of companies that develop ethical principles are listed in the Northern region and belong to the Technology and Telecommunications industries. The study provides evidence of AI disclosure, a type of non-financial disclosure that has not been explored yet in the literature. Unlike existing studies, we propose a first definition of the topic and a taxonomy that can be used in further research on AI disclosure and can contribute to the development of KPIs in the field. Furthermore, this study provides a theoretical framework integrating some traditional theories, such as Voluntary disclosure theory, Signalling theory, and Legitimacy theory, specifically drawn to interpret AI disclosure practices, which can help with a further in-depth exploration of AI disclosure combining concurrent perspectives.

To answer this need, here we analyze three key challenges to interdisciplinary AI research, and deliver three broad conclusions: 1) future development of AI should not only impact other scientific domains but should also take inspiration and benefit from other fields of science, 2) AI research must be accompanied by decision explainability, dataset bias transparency as well as development of evaluation methodologies and creation of regulatory agencies to ensure responsibility, and 3) AI education should receive more attention, efforts and innovation from the educational and scientific communities.

The rapid growth in food production through specialized operations such as monoculture cropping systems has aligned to satisfy increases in demand for food and fiber. However, its adverse impacts on natural resources pose huge challenges for the sustainability of food production. The situation is direr for developing countries or rural regions of the world due to the limited resources available to farming communities in these regions. To avoid production agriculture being at the proverbial crossroads we suggest an alternate approach. One that involves the sustainable use of natural resources without adverse environmental impacts by relying less on production inputs whether it be agrochemicals or machineries. We examined the extent to which regenerative agriculture, permaculture, and smart technology have evolved in response to sustainable agricultural production, agricultural decision support system, and overall global food security. Collectively, regenerative agriculture and permaculture are semi-closed holistic systems approach designed to reduce or eliminate dependence on external inputs (e.g., chemicals) which restores and maintains natural systems (e.g., soil quality, biodiversity, and ecosystem services). We suggest that fully embracing modern regenerative agriculture as well as integrated permaculture will improve soil health, ecosystem biodiversity, land and resource conservation, agricultural sustainability, and food security.

Applications of emerging technologies in digital agri-culture, including the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence and machine learning, drones, use of new physical systems (e.g., advanced robotics, autonomous vehicles, advanced materials), and gene technology (e.g., biofortified crops, genome-wide selection, genome editing), are dis-cussed in this study. Additionally, we suggest eight action initiatives, which are transforming mind-sets, enabling social licensing, changing policies and regulations, designing market incentives, safe-guarding against undesirable effects, ensuring stable finance, building trust, and developing transition pathways that can hasten the transition to more SFSs.

One primary purpose of the study is to modify the indicators of the traditional assessment approach to suit the regional environmental conditions of the selected areas. As two of the twenty-five Iranian wetlands with international importance, Kanibarazan and Choghakhor wetlands were selected as the study areas due to their significant roles in protecting the biodiversity of their regions. The wetlands are supported by the international Ramsar Convention on Wetlands to mandate and encourage the local authorities towards their conservation and sustainable exploitation. In this regard, the Iranian Department of Environment, in cooperation with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), selected these wetlands to demonstrate new approaches of managing the wetland areas protected by the Conservation of Iranian Wetlands Project (CIWP). A real-time wetland monitoring station with hydrological instruments, including water level, air temperature, air humidity, and water quality multi-parameter sensors recording water temperature, pH, electrical conductivity, and dissolved oxygen (DO), was implanted at the deepest part of both wetlands. The manual sampling of water quality parameters was also carried out periodically during specific intervals. The relative importance of the wetland health indicators involved in the FIS was determined via the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), utilizing the knowledge of local experts, including academic staff, environmental specialists, and natives, to localize the traditional assessment approach. In turn, the health level categories of both wetlands were assessed using the traditional and proposed wetland health assessment approaches. The efficiency of the proposed method was evaluated with the selected case studies, and it proved to be a more flexible and appropriate approach for wetland health assessment. Furthermore, the observed differences between the health level of the first case study pointed to the efficiency of the AHP-FIS method in improving the traditional index. Besides, feedforward neural network (FFNN) and support vector regression (SVR) artificial intelligence (AI) methods were used to model DO as one of the most critical water quality parameters in maintaining the biological integrity of wetland ecosystems. The obtained results indicated that FFNN performed slightly better than SVR in predicting DO of both wetlands. Consequently, the results of DO modeling were used to investigate the possibility of employing AI models in wetland health assessment in case of unavailability or failures of DO sensors, which was considered practical considering the suitable performance of AI models and the obtained wetland health level results based on the predicted DO. Highlights: 1. A wetland health assessment approach based on fuzzy logic was developed. 2. Two freshwater wetlands were selected as real case study areas. 3. The fuzzy inference system and analytic hierarchy process were used to improve the process. 4. The proposed approach showed more flexibility and efficiency. 5. Two AI methods were used to model DO and investigate their applicability in health assessment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society of Wetland Scientists.','method',0,'Health Assessment Approach for the Management of Freshwater Wetland Ecosystems','means','conservation and sustainable use','local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Iran','field data, land and water characteristics','Iran',0),('2-s2.0-85117732239','Blockchain; Cryptography; Digital storage; Internet of things; Long short-term memory; Network security; Smart city; Sustainable development; Virtual reality; Virtualization; Block-chain; Current situation; Deep LSTM; Energy efficient; Management IS; Parking spaces; Smart parking; Sustainable cities; Vehicles managements; Virtualizations; energy efficiency; Internet; parking; sustainability; travel behavior; urban area; urban planning; urban transport; Energy efficiency','method',0,'smart city; mobility and transport','means','Smart cities significantly contribute to a sustainable environment using ICT to acquire application data and enhance performance and manageable tasks (Ghani et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2014).

The increase in production of electronic products and the growing inherent need to own the latest technology available has led to a significant increase in the amount of E-waste produced each year. India generated 3.2 million tonnes of E-waste in 2020, with metropolitan cities like Mumbai, Delhi and Bangalore leading the list. Proper management and recycling of E-wastes are critical for the sustainability of any modern city today. While industrial and commercial collection of E-wastes has been in the spotlight, solutions for collection of E-wastes from individual households are limited. This article proposes the implementation of a mobile robot that identifies common electronic wastes based on transfer learning and serves as an attachment to existing municipality garbage trucks. The robot moves around, identifies electronic wastes and performs segregation of the identified material via its arm-based lift and storage mechanism. A convolutional neural network–based identification system has been employed for categorising the E-wastes and yields 96% accuracy. This is a first of its kind attempt, especially in India, to collect and segregate E-wastes from homes and individuals.

Further, contemporary data-intensive industries have seen a sharp upsurge in the resource requirements of modern applications. This has led to the provisioning of an increased number of cloud servers, giving rise to higher energy consumption and, consequently, sustainability concerns. Traditional heuristics and reinforcement learning based algorithms for energy-efficient cloud resource management address the scalability and adaptability related challenges to a limited extent. Existing work often fails to capture dependencies across thermal characteristics of hosts, resource consumption of tasks and the corresponding scheduling decisions. This leads to poor scalability and an increase in the compute resource requirements, particularly in environments with non-stationary resource demands. To address these limitations, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) based holistic resource management technique for sustainable cloud computing called HUNTER. The proposed model formulates the goal of optimizing energy efficiency in data centers as a multi-objective scheduling problem, considering three important models: energy, thermal and cooling.

This study examined the potential contribution of digitalization of the food system to such transition by reviewing 76 relevant journal articles, indexed on the Scopus database, using the integrative literature review approach and descriptive content analysis with MAXQDA 2020 software. ‘Blockchain’ was the top hit among keywords and main concepts applied to the food system. The UK as a country and Europe as a continent were found to lead the scientific research on food system digitalization. Use of digital technologies such as blockchain, the Internet of Things, big-data analytics, artificial intelligence, and related information and communications technologies were identified as enablers. Traceability, sustainability, resilience to crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and reducing food waste were among the key benefit areas associated with digitalization for different food commodities. Challenges to practical applications related to infrastructure and cost, knowledge and skill, law and regulations, the nature of the technologies, and the nature of the food system were identified.

This reality leads to a paradigm shift in which web-based cyber-physical environments will shape future learning environments. Thus, learning becomes ubiquitous, and schools assume new roles with systemic changes in communication, administration and management, becoming learning organisations. The use of technologies aligned with pedagogical strategies and new methodologies must lead to more-personalised systems. In this article, a comprehensive definition of smart schools is proposed. Smart schools must be endowed with integral management systems, inclusive, sustainable, and adopt new learning methodologies and advances from Industry 4.0 in an efficient way. Despite this conception and because research, government policies and business projects are not always in line with research, there is a need for deeper knowledge of how schools are approaching their upcoming transformation. To illuminate this purpose, in this study 37 principals from primary and secondary schools in Catalonia were interviewed. Thematic analysis focusing on technological and pedagogical innovations, management systems, inclusion, and sustainability identified some analogies with related research, pointing out that schools are far from implementing advanced technologies. Inclusion is the most-respected element thanks to the existing government regulation. Sustainability is hardly considered because of a lack of economic resources, but several schools consider themselves green schools and exhibit environmental practices. Conclusions are drawn to show that, although schools are not yet prepared to cope with the Fourth Industrial Revolution, its impact relies on the technology’s level of maturity and ease of use, as well as stakeholders as policymakers. © 2021, The Author(s).','study object',0,'How school principals from Catalonia approach the future of education within the fourth industrial revolution','means',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','qualitative','Spain',NULL,'Spain',0),('2-s2.0-85118703265','Groundwater quality appraisal is one of the most crucial tasks to ensure safe drinking water sources. Concurrently, a water quality index (WQI) requires some water quality parameters. Conventionally, WQI computation consumes time and is often found with various errors during subindex calculation. To this end, 8 artificial intelligence algorithms, e.g., multilinear regression (MLR), random forest (RF), M5P tree (M5P), random subspace (RSS), additive regression (AR), artificial neural network (ANN), support vector regression (SVR), and locally weighted linear regression (LWLR), were employed to generate WQI prediction in Illizi region, southeast Algeria. Using the best subset regression, 12 different input combinations were developed and the strategy of work was based on two scenarios. The first scenario aims to reduce the time consumption in WQI computation, where all parameters were used as inputs. The second scenario intends to show the water quality variation in the critical cases when the necessary analyses are unavailable, whereas all inputs were reduced based on sensitivity analysis. The models were appraised using several statistical metrics including correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), relative absolute error (RAE), and root relative square error (RRSE). The results reveal that TDS and TH are the key drivers influencing WQI in the study area. The comparison of performance evaluation metric shows that the MLR model has the higher accuracy compared to other models in the first scenario in terms of 1, 1.4572*10–08, 2.1418*10–08, 1.2573*10–10%, and 3.1708*10–08% for R, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE, respectively. The second scenario was executed with less error rate by using the RF model with 0.9984, 1.9942, 3.2488, 4.693, and 5.9642 for R, MAE, RMSE, RAE, and RRSE, respectively.

An increasing amount of empirical evidence has suggested the potential benefits of incorporating digital technologies and artificial intelligence in various educational contexts, such as the K-12 education, and a change in learning modality in the unprecedented period of COVID-19. In chemical education, various types of emerging technologies, such as eye-tracking techniques, learning analytics, robotics, virtual reality (VR), and augmented reality (AR), have seen wide applications and promising prospects. In this paper, a systematic review of emerging technologies adopted in chemical education during this era of digitalization and artificial intelligence is presented. The current study aims to identify the major types of technologies adopted in chemical education and analyze the empirical findings from relevant studies. A total of 45 studies between 2010 and 2021 were analyzed through a literature search in three inter-disciplinary databases: Web of Science, Scopus, and the Educational Information Resource Center. Full-text retrieval and analysis of the included studies were conducted. The present study finds that AR and VR applications were most extensively investigated among the identified types of technologies adopted in chemical education, while the major focus areas were associated with virtual chemistry laboratories, visualization and interaction with chemical structures, and classroom hands-on activities. The evidence presented in this study also indicates the promising applications of artificial intelligence and learning analytics in the analysis of students’ feedback and behavior, assessment of students’ understanding of chemical concepts, and investigations of students’ reasoning and cognitive processes during chemical tasks such as spectral interpretation. Furthermore, areas requiring more research, investigations, potential future applications, as well as pedagogical implications of education for sustainable development will be identified based on the evidence presented in this study.

However, large-scale applications of AI are still limited. One barrier is the lack of quantitative understandings of the potential benefits and risks of different AI applications. This study reviewed relevant AI literature and categorized those case studies by application types, impact categories, and application modes. Most studies assessed the energy, economic, and safety implications of AI applications, while few of them have evaluated the environmental impacts of AI, given the large data gaps and difficulties in choosing appropriate assessment methods. Based on the reviewed case studies in the chemical industry, we proposed a conceptual framework that encompasses approaches from industrial ecology, economics, and engineering to guide the selection of performance indicators and evaluation methods for a holistic assessment of AI\'s impacts. This framework could be a valuable tool to support the decision-making related to AI in the fundamental research and practical production of chemicals. Although this study focuses on the chemical industry, the insights of the literature review and the proposed framework could be applied to AI applications in other industries and broad industrial ecology fields.

The data for this study is collated through documentary and an in-depth semi-structured interviews from the world\'s largest medical drone programme in Ghana. Findings indicate that an AI-enhanced medical drone application in HSC contributes significantly to the host country\'s HSC and sustainable development goals (SDGs) with particular emphasis on climate (SDGs 3, 8 & 13). The SDGs are achieved through the reduction of carbon emission with carbon and noise-free drones in the delivery of emergency medical products to healthcare centres. Furthermore, by adopting the use of medical drones in the HSC system, society\'s socio-economic situations are improved through the reduction of mortality rates and may lead to the provision of better social and economic lives for the citizenry.

Water meter data collection is an essential step toward this goal. In Morocco, this task is performed manually at most once a month due to constraints related to the cost and time. In general, the consumption is estimated and calculated based on the average consumption recorded in the previous months. This causes many claims from customers because of higher invoices, which does not reflect reality. In this paper, we propose a fully AI-based system to automate water meter data collection, which is composed of a Recognition System (RS) and a web services platform. This framework offers multiple services for both customers and water service providers, such as consumption monitoring, detecting water leaks, visualizing water consumption, and potable water coverage in a geographic map. It also provides a powerful tool to help ensure accurate decision making with multiple reporting services.

In many cases, these new technologies are not specific to the field of healthcare. Still, they are existent, ubiquitous, and commercially available systems upskilled to integrate these novel care practices. Given the widespread adoption, coupled with the dramatic changes in practices, new ethical and social issues emerge due to how these systems nudge users into making decisions and changing behaviours. This article discusses how these AI-driven systems pose particular ethical challenges with regards to nudging. To confront these issues, the value sensitive design (VSD) approach is adopted as a principled methodology that designers can adopt to design these systems to avoid harming and contribute to the social good. The AI for Social Good (AI4SG) factors are adopted as the norms constraining maleficence. In contrast, higher-order values specific to AI, such as those from the EU High-Level Expert Group on AI and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, are adopted as the values to be promoted as much as possible in design.

Numerous studies on the development of air quality forecasting model using machine learning have been conducted to control air pollution. As such, there are significant numbers of reviews on the application of machine learning in air quality forecasting. Shallow architectures of machine learning exhibit several limitations and yield lower forecasting accuracy than deep learning architecture. Deep learning is a new technology in computational intelligence; thus, its application in air quality forecasting is still limited. This study aims to investigate the deep learning applications in time series air quality forecasting. Owing to this, literature search is conducted thoroughly from all scientific databases to avoid unnecessary clutter. This study summarizes and discusses different types of deep learning algorithms applied in air quality forecasting, including the theoretical backgrounds, hyperparameters, applications and limitations. Hybrid deep learning with data decomposition, optimization algorithm and spatiotemporal models are also presented to highlight those techniques’ effectiveness in tackling the drawbacks of individual deep learning models. It is clearly stated that hybrid deep learning was able to forecast future air quality with higher accuracy than individual models.

This is particularly relevant to the wine industry as growers face disruptive challenges caused by climate change, shortages of labour and escalating production costs. In recent years there has been considerable development and testing of non-invasive digital technologies, some of which have already demonstrated an improvement in the way that wine grapes are grown, managed and harvested to produce quality wines in a manner that is both environmentally and economically sustainable. In this paper, we describe a number of sensing technologies including spectroscopy, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging, chlorophyll fluorescence, thermography, electrical resistivity, laser imaging detection and ranging, and computer vision and the platforms where they are generally mounted or embedded for either proximal or remote monitoring. Artificial intelligence is also discussed as it is useful as a means of transforming data into different pieces of information used by the grape grower for making informed decisions. A key objective of using these technologies is to obtain and supply data and information to grape growers and wine producers as a basis for improving land and vine management through a more-informed decision-making process. The current and future application of these technologies and artificial intelligence in vineyards are discussed in relation to soil properties and topography, vegetative growth, canopy architecture, nutrient and water status, pests and diseases, crop forecasting, yield and fruit composition, vineyard sampling, targeted management and selective harvesting.

At the same time, the environmental branch of toxicology has gained significant attention in understanding the effect of toxic chemicals on human health. Environmental toxic agents cause several diseases, particularly high risk among children, pregnant women, geriatrics and clinical patients. Since air pollution affects human health and results in increased morbidity and mortality increased the toxicological studies focusing on industrial air pollution absorbed by the common people. Therefore, it is needed to design an automated Environmental Toxicology based Air Pollution Monitoring System. To resolve the limitations of traditional monitoring system and to reduce the overall cost, this paper designs an IoT enabled Environmental Toxicology for Air Pollution Monitoring using Artificial Intelligence technique (ETAPM-AIT) to improve human health. The proposed ETAPM-AIT model includes a set of IoT based sensor array to sense eight pollutants namely NH3, CO, NO2, CH4, CO2, PM2.5, temperature and humidity. The sensor array measures the pollutant level and transmits it to the cloud server via gateways for analytic process. The proposed model aims to report the status of air quality in real time by using cloud server and sends an alarm in the presence of hazardous pollutants level in the air. For the classification of air pollutants and determining air quality, Artificial Algae Algorithm (AAA) based Elman Neural Network (ENN) model is used as a classifier, which predicts the air quality in the forthcoming time stamps. The AAA is applied as a parameter tuning technique to optimally determine the parameter values of the ENN model. In-order to examine the air quality monitoring performance of the proposed ETAPM-AIT model, an extensive set of simulation analysis is performed and the results are inspected in 5, 15, 30 and 60 min of duration respectively.

This study employs different artificial intelligence (AI) scenarios to determine biomass heat capacity (Cp). Cumulatively, 1025 experimental measurements for 25 different biomass types (block and powder forms) were utilized to design/identify the most accurate AI model. Validity checking approves that more than 98% of the data are valid. The Cp is estimated as a function of biomass source, appearance shape, and temperature. The cascade feedforward (CFF) neural network appears as the most precise tool for the concerned matter.

The (co-)combustion performances, gas emissions, and ashes of TDS and two plastics of polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) were quantified and characterized. The increased blend ratio of PP and PE improved the ignition, burnout, and comprehensive combustion indices. The two plastics interacted with TDS significantly in the range of 200–600 ℃. TDS pre-ignited the combustion of the plastics which in turn promoted the combustion of TDS. The co-combustions released more CO2 but less CH4, C-H, and C[dbnd]O as CO2 was less persistent than the others in the atmosphere. The Ca-based minerals in the plastics enhanced S-fixation and reduced SO2 emission. The activation energy of the co-combustion fell from 126.78 to 111.85 kJ/mol and 133.71–79.91 kJ/mol when the PE and PP additions rose from 10% to 50%, respectively. The co-combustion reaction mechanism was best described by the model of f(α) = (1-α)n. The reaction order was reduced with the additions of the plastics.

Unfortunately, such areas are very sensitive to changes due to human activity, natural phenomenon, introduction of non-native species, and climate change. Thus, the main objective of this research is the implementation of a robust image processing methodology to produce accurate bathymetry maps in shallow coastal waters using high-resolution multispectral WorldView-2/3 satellite imagery for the monitoring at the maximum spatial and spectral resolutions. Two different island ecosystems have been selected for the assessment, since they stand out for their richness in endemic species and they are more vulnerable to climate change: Cabrera National Park and Maspalomas Natural Protected area, located in the Balearic and Canary Islands, Spain, respectively. In addition, a third example to show the applicability of the mapping methodology to monitor the construction of a new port in Granadilla (Canary Islands) is presented. Contributions of this work focus on improving the preprocessing methodology and, mainly, on the proposal and assessment of new satellite-derived regression and machine learning bathymetric models, which have been validated and compared with respect to measured reference bathymetry.

Thus, researchers have focused on developing models for estimating soil quality based on artificial intelligence techniques for the processing of multidimensional data from agro-industrial systems, which provide useful information for farmers about soil management and crop conditions. However, a model for the application of these new technologies in medium and low-scale agricultural systems has not been identified. Therefore, a review of recent studies of crop yield prediction based on the estimation of chemical, physical, and biological soil quality indicators (SQI), which incorporate different machine learning (ML) techniques to process data from remote sensing (RS) systems, is presented. The advantages and disadvantages are also analyzed for: SQI estimates at regional and local scale, spectral bands used for analysis of plowed soils (bare soils) of cultivation plots, selection of minimun data set (MDS), use of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) and satellite platforms, data pre-processing, and selection of ML algorithms for processing biological systems databases (agro-industrial systems). Finally, we present a model to help estimate soil quality in agricultural systems at a local scale, based on ML to process RS data, in the model the inputs to the ML unit come from four different class data sets (RS, SQI, environmental data and crop management data).

These services are realized through control and monitoring applications that are typically developed using artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) based algorithms, that play a significant role to highlight the efficiency of traditional healthcare systems. Current personalized healthcare services are dedicated in a specific environment to support technological personalization (e.g., personalized gadgets/devices). However, they are unable to consider different inter-related health conditions, leading to inappropriate diagnosis and affect sustainability and the long-term health/life of patients. Towards this problem, the state-of-the-art Healthcare 5.0 technology has evolved that supersede previous healthcare technologies. The goal of healthcare 5.0 is to achieve a fully autonomous healthcare service, that takes into account the interdependent effect of different health conditions of a patient. This paper conducts a comprehensive survey on personalized healthcare services. In particular, we first present an overview of key requirements of comprehensive personalized healthcare services (CPHS) in modern healthcare Internet of Things (HIoT), including the definition of personalization and an example use case scenario as a representative for modern HIoT.

It has been reshaping human life daily during the last decade, with various applications in several critical domains such as agriculture. Smart farming is a real-world application in which Internet of Things (IoT) technologies like agro-weather stations can have a direct impact on humans by enhancing crop quality, supporting sustainable agriculture, and eventually generating steady growth. Meanwhile, most agro-weather solutions are neither customized nor affordable for small farmers within developing countries. Furthermore, due to the outdoor challenges, it is often a challenge to develop and deploy low-cost yet robust systems. Robustness, which is determined by several factors, including energy consumption, portability, interoperability, and system’s ease of use. In this paper, we present an agile AI-Powered IoT-based low-cost platform for cognitive monitoring for smart farming. The hybrid Multi-Agent and the fully containerized system continuously surveys multiple agriculture parameters such as temperature, humidity, and pressure to provide end-users with real-time environmental data and AI-based forecasts. The surveyed data is ensured through several heterogeneous nodes deployed within the base station and in the open sensing area. The collected data is transmitted to the local server for pre-processing and the cloud server for backup. The system backbone communication is based on heterogeneous protocols such as MQTT, NRF24L01, and WiFi for radio communication.

A protein content of up to 45% makes duckweed biomass nutritionally interesting as an ingredient for animal feeds or human food. Outdoor duckweed cultivation has become common in recent decades but can be difficult to optimise and to control operationally. Yet, duckweeds also represent a suitable crop for indoor farming, with most species due to their flat structure particularly suited for cultivation in multi-level (stacked) systems that use indoor floor space efficiently. Here we propose construction of stacked systems with up to 15 m2 of duckweed per m2 of floorspace. Such stacked systems are facilitated by limiting the water depth to about 5 cm. Indoor cultivation can maximise yields, and doubling times as short as 1.24 days have been reported under indoor conditions. Indoor cultivation also extends the scope for crop manipulation and enables cultivation under pest-free and even sterile conditions. Yet, the technical and operational parameters required for effective large-scale indoor cultivation of Lemnaceae have received scant attention in the literature. Here, it is concluded that technological advances in urban and/or vertical farming can be exploited to enable design and operation of novel duckweed cultivation systems. Recirculating, flow through technology can optimise nutrient supply and growth, while sensor support systems with artificial intelligence can facilitate autonomous cropping and even harvesting. Furthermore, advanced understanding of duckweed-biology can, amongst others, inform selection of (wastewater-based) media, flow-rates and media retention time, duckweed species and strains, and enhance performance through manipulation of the duckweed microbiome.

The objectives were to develop DL models to predict AGB in the tropical evergreen broadleaf forests and compare DL models with traditional regression equations for their reliability in AGB prediction. A total of 968 individual trees were destructively sampled from fourteen 1-ha and twenty-six 0.2-ha plots distributed across five ecoregions of Viet Nam to get a dataset of tree predictors of diameter at breast height (DBH), tree height (H), wood density (WD) and the response variable of AGB along with forest stand factors of basal area (BA) and density (N); ecological and environmental variables such as ecoregion, slope, altitude, soil type, averaged annual temperature (T), averaged annual rainfall (P) and averaged dry season length. The DL models were developed using different combinations of variables selected by factor analysis for mixed data and compared with traditional regression equations by using cross-validation. Trees AGB in tropical rainforest predicted by DL models had significantly higher reliability than the conventional regression equations when both had the same input variables. Of the 16 developed DL models with 1 to 9 predictors, the model with 9 predictors (DBH, H, Ecoregion, Altitude, P, T, Soil type, N and WD) was the best DL model which reduced root mean square percent error (RMSPE) and mean absolute percent error (MAPE) by up to 7.7% and 6.1%, respectively, compared to traditional allometric equations. The DL models created in this study should be applied for measured tree data following factors of the forest stand, ecology, and environment in sampled plots to predict the tree AGB and total AGB, carbon on a large scale with variation in the value of these factors.

The challenge of increasing crop yield while ensuring sustainable development of environmentally friendly agriculture is a common issue through-out the world. Autonomous systems, sensing technologies, and artificial intelligence offer great opportunities to tackle this issue. In precision agriculture (PA), non-destructive and non-invasive remote and proximal sensing methods have been widely used to observe crops in visible and invisible spectra. Nowadays, the integration of high-performance imagery sensors (e.g., RGB, multispec-tral, hyperspectral, thermal, and SAR) and unmanned mobile platforms (e.g., satellites, UAVs, and terrestrial agricultural robots) are yielding a huge number of high-resolution farmland images, in which rich crop information is compressed. However, this has been accompanied by challenges, i.e., ways to swiftly and efficiently making full use of these images, and then, to perform fine crop management based on information-supported decision making. In the past few years, deep learning (DL) has shown great potential to reshape many industries because of its powerful capabilities of feature learning from massive datasets, and the agriculture industry is no exception. More and more agricultural scientists are paying attention to applications of deep learning in image-based farmland observations, such as land mapping, crop classification, biotic/abiotic stress monitoring, and yield prediction. To provide an update on these studies, we conducted a comprehensive investigation with a special emphasis on deep learning in multiscale agricultural remote and proximal sensing. Specifically, the applications of convolutional neural network-based supervised learning (CNN-SL), transfer learning (TL), and few-shot learning (FSL) in crop sensing at land, field, canopy, and leaf scales are the focus of this review. We hope that this work can act as a reference for the global agricultural community regarding DL in PA and can inspire deeper and broader research to promote the evolution of modern agriculture. © 2022 by the authors.

Despite the enthusiasm, health care professionals still struggle to implement AI in their daily practice. Objective: This paper aims to identify the implementation frameworks used to understand the application of AI in health care practice. Methods: A scoping review was conducted using the Cochrane, Evidence Based Medicine Reviews, Embase, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases to identify publications that reported frameworks, models, and theories concerning AI implementation in health care. This review focused on studies published in English and investigating AI implementation in health care since 2000. A total of 2541 unique publications were retrieved from the databases and screened on titles and abstracts by 2 independent reviewers. Selected articles were thematically analyzed against the Nilsen taxonomy of implementation frameworks, and the Greenhalgh framework for the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability (NASSS) of health care technologies. Results: In total, 7 articles met all eligibility criteria for inclusion in the review, and 2 articles included formal frameworks that directly addressed AI implementation, whereas the other articles provided limited descriptions of elements influencing implementation. Collectively, the 7 articles identified elements that aligned with all the NASSS domains, but no single article comprehensively considered the factors known to influence technology implementation. New domains were identified, including dependency on data input and existing processes, shared decision-making, the role of human oversight, and ethics of population impact and inequality, suggesting that existing frameworks do not fully consider the unique needs of AI implementation. Conclusions: This literature review demonstrates that understanding how to implement AI in health care practice is still in its early stages of development.

As a more concrete example, the first and second cycle SPs titled ‘Artificial Intelligence’ are described and analyzed in all relevant perspectives of sustainability.

Multimodality imaging plays a fundamental role in both diagnosis and risk stratification of acute and chronic CAD. For example, the role of Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (CCTA) has become increasingly important to rule out CAD according to the latest guidelines. These changes and others will likely increase the request for appropriate imaging tests in the future. In this setting, artificial intelligence (AI) will play a pivotal role in echocardiography, CCTA, cardiac magnetic resonance and nuclear imaging, making multimodality imaging more efficient and reliable for clinicians, as well as more sustainable for healthcare systems. Furthermore, AI can assist clinicians in identifying early predictors of adverse outcome that human eyes cannot see in the fog of “big data.” AI algorithms applied to multimodality imaging will play a fundamental role in the management of patients with suspected or established CAD.

Hence, this study aims to integrate waste management and artificial intelligence by developing an artificial neural network (ANN) model to predict the compressive strength of green concrete. The proposed model allows the use of recycled coarse aggregate (RCA), recycled fine aggregate (RFA) and fly ash (FA) as partial replacements of concrete constituents. Design/methodology/approach: The model is constructed, trained and validated using python through a set of experimental data collected from the literature. The model’s architecture comprises an input layer containing seven neurons representing concrete constituents and two neurons as the output layer to represent the 7- and 28-days compressive strength. The model showed high performance through multiple metrics, including mean squared error (MSE) of 2.41 and 2.00 for training and testing data sets, respectively. Findings: Results showed that cement replacement with 10% FA causes a slight reduction up to 9% in the compressive strength, especially at early ages. Moreover, a decrease of nearly 40% in the 28-days compressive strength was noticed when replacing fine aggregate with 25% RFA. Research limitations/implications: The research is limited to normal compressive strength of green concrete with a range of 25 to 40 MPa. Practical implications: The developed model is designed in a flexible and user-friendly manner to be able to contribute to the sustainable development of the construction industry by saving time, effort and cost consumed in the experimental testing of materials. Social implications: Green concrete containing wastes can solve several environmental problems, such as waste disposal problems, depletion of natural resources and energy consumption. Originality/value: This research proposes a machine learning prediction model using the Python programming language to estimate the compressive strength of a green concrete mix that includes construction and demolition waste and FA. The ANN model is used to create three guidance charts through a parametric study to obtain the compressive strength of green concrete using RCA, RFA and FA replacements. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.','study object',0,'compressive strength of a green concrete','means','The development of an ANN prediction model ​that combines both waste management and artificial intelligence techniques contributes to the ​sustainable development of the construction industry by saving the time, effort and cost consumed ​in the experimental testing of construction materials.

The last decade has witnessed significant endeavors in striking a balance between ethical considerations and health transformation led by AI. Despite a growing interest in AI ethics, implementing AI-related technologies and initiatives responsibly in healthcare settings remains a challenge. In response to this topical challenge, we reviewed 253 articles pertaining to AI ethics in healthcare published between 2000 and 2020, summarizing the coherent themes of responsible AI initiatives. A preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analysis (PRISMA) approach was employed to screen and select articles, and a hermeneutic approach was adopted to conduct systematic literature review. By synthesizing relevant knowledge from AI governance and ethics, we propose a responsible AI initiative framework that encompasses five core themes for AI solution developers, healthcare professionals, and policy makers.

Wearable monitors and artificial intelligence–based decision support systems could be integrated with hospital-based digital health systems such as electronic health records (EHRs) to provide higher level care at a relatively low cost. However, the appropriate and sustainable application of these innovations in low- and middle-income countries requires an understanding of the local government’s requirements and regulations such as technology specifications, cybersecurity, data-sharing protocols, and interoperability. Objective: This scoping review aims to explore the current state of digital health research and the policies that govern the adoption of digital health systems in Vietnamese hospitals. Methods: We conducted a scoping review using a modification of the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses Extension for Scoping Reviews) guidelines. PubMed and Web of Science were searched for academic publications, and Th Vi n Pháp Lu t, a proprietary database of Vietnamese government documents, and the Vietnam Electronic Health Administration website were searched for government documents. Google Scholar and Google Search were used for snowballing searches. The sources were assessed against predefined eligibility criteria through title, abstract, and full-text screening. Relevant information from the included sources was charted and summarized. The review process was primarily undertaken by one researcher and reviewed by another researcher during each step. Results: In total, 11 academic publications and 20 government documents were included in this review. Among the academic studies, 5 reported engineering solutions for information systems in hospitals, 2 assessed readiness for EHR implementation, 1 tested physicians’ performance before and after using clinical decision support software, 1 reported a national laboratory information management system, and 2 reviewed the health system’s capability to implement eHealth and artificial intelligence. Of the 20 government documents, 19 were promulgated from 2013 to 2020. These regulations and guidance cover a wide range of digital health domains, including hospital information management systems, general and interoperability standards, cybersecurity in health organizations, conditions for the provision of health information technology (HIT), electronic health insurance claims, laboratory information systems, HIT maturity, digital health strategies, electronic medical records, EHRs, and eHealth architectural frameworks. Conclusions: Research about hospital-based digital health systems in Vietnam is very limited, particularly implementation studies. Government regulations and guidance for HIT in health care organizations have been released with increasing frequency since 2013, targeting a variety of information systems such as electronic medical records, EHRs, and laboratory information systems. In general, these policies were focused on the basic specifications and standards that digital health systems need to meet.

In the health sector, the pandemic halted and reversed progress in health and subsequently shortened life expectancy, especially in developing and underdeveloped nations. On the other hand, machine learning and artificial intelligence contributed a great deal to the handling of the pandemic globally. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the role played by artificial intelligence and machine learning in addressing the dangers posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as extrapolate the lessons on the fourth industrial revolution and sustainable development goals. Using qualitative content analysis, the results indicated that artificial intelligence and machine learning played an important role in the response to the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Artificial intelligence, machine learning, and various digital communication tools through telehealth performed meaningful roles in scaling cus-tomer communications, provided a platform for understanding how COVID-19 spreads, and sped up research and treatment of COVID-19, among other notable achievements. The lessons we draw from this is that, despite the disruptions and the rise in the number of unintended consequences of technology in the fourth industrial revolution, the role played by artificial intelligence and machine learning motivates us to conclude that governments must build trust in these technologies, to address health problems going forward, to ensure that the sustainable development goals related to good health and wellbeing are achieved. © 2022 by the authors.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is applied in virtually every area of society, the economy, and the environment. Given the significant impact of inequality in the development of AI on economic growth and sustainable economic welfare, we propose an improved ISEW, namely, AI-ISEW. This paper explores the AI-ISEW gap in China and its influencing factors in the context of uneven AI development. We calculate the ISEW and AI-ISEW for 30 provinces in mainland China from 2003 to 2019 and discuss highly controversial methodological assumptions related to income inequality, long-term environmental damage, and nonrenewable energy consumption. The Dagum Gini coefficient is used to reveal regional differences in AI-ISEW, kernel density estimation is used to describe the dynamic evolutionary trend of AI-ISEW development, and quadratic assignment procedure regression is used to explore the factors influencing the AI-ISEW gap. The study found that the AI-ISEW is on the rise, but its growth rate is generally lower than that of GDP. Compared to the AI-ISEW, the ISEW generally overestimates economic welfare. There are regional differences in China’s AI-ISEW, and the main source of differences is interregional differences. Regarding internal differences in each region, the average Gini coefficient from large to small displays the following order: east > west > central > northeast. Adjusted personal consumption is the greatest factor contributing to the AI-ISEW gap. The most economically developed regions have the greatest disparities in welfare. The research reveals the evolutionary trend of China’s sustainable economic welfare from the perspective of AI development and provides evidence for improving the level of economic welfare and accelerating regional coordinated development. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.','study object',0,'evaluation of the index of sustainable economic welfare based on artificial intelligence','end','Sustainable Economic Welfare','national','longitudinal','past','quantitative','China','China Statistical Yearbook','China',0),('2-s2.0-85125111843','As education is an essential enabler in achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), it should “ensure inclusive, equitable quality education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all”. One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of “equitable quality education”. To attain and work in the context of SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in education to create better learning. To provide better education, data analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP). A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of 97.03%, sensitivity value of 95.26%, specificity value of 98.8%, precision value of 98.86%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of 94% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99%. Hence, such a method is very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for students in virtual education systems. © 2022 by the authors.

This study aims to simulate input runoff to a dam reservoir in an arid region under changing climatic conditions using three data-mining algorithms, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Genetic Expression Programming (GEP), and the conceptual HYMOD model. Three parameters containing precipitation and maximum and minimum temperature were simulated from 30 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) and Global Climate Models (GCMs) for the future period (2020–2040) under the high-end RCP8.5 scenario. The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) was selected as a downscaling method. The Gamma and M tests (This is an exam to determine whether an infinite series of functions will converge uniformly and absolutely or not) were applied to detect the best combinations and number of input parameters for the models, respectively. Among 29 defined input parameters for the models, the gamma test identified 11 parameters with the best functionality to simulate runoff. Based on the reliability estimates of model error variance by the M test, the data were partitioned as 75% for learning and the other 25% for test verification. A comparison of the runoff simulations of the models revealed a remarkable performance of the SVM model by 3, 5, and 14% compared to ANNs, GEP, and HYMOD models, respectively. The SVM model forecasted a 25% decrease in the mean runoff input to the dam reservoir for the 2020–2040 period compared to the study period (2000–2019).

According to the studied companies, AI regulations are difficult to understand and implement. There is also much to be done in terms of reliability, transparency, and safety. Consequently, companies suggested that AI-based products should be more preventive, safe, explicable, and equally accessible. Sufficient information, multi-professional support also within company, global collaboration, sharing best practices, and general discussion were emphasised. The results show that EdTech companies are aware of their ethical challenges, and their responsibility as disseminators of information.

Effective AI governance is not only about legal compliance; organizations can strive to go beyond legal requirements by proactively considering the risks inherent in their AI systems. In the past decade, investors have become increasingly active in advancing corporate social responsibility and sustainability practices. Including nonfinancial information related to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) issues in investment analyses has become mainstream practice among investors. However, the AI auditing literature is mostly silent on the role of investors. The current study addresses two research questions: (1) how companies’ responsible use of AI is included in ESG investment analyses and (2) what connections can be found between principles of responsible AI and ESG ranking criteria. We conducted a series of expert interviews and analyzed the data using thematic analysis. Awareness of AI issues, measuring AI impacts, and governing AI processes emerged as the three main themes in the analysis. The findings indicate that AI is still a relatively unknown topic for investors, and taking the responsible use of AI into account in ESG analyses is not an established practice. However, AI is recognized as a potentially material issue for various industries and companies, indicating that its incorporation into ESG evaluations may be justified.

However, AI may also lead to patient harm due to fatal glitches in robotic surgery, bias in diagnosis, or dangerous recommendations. Despite concerns ethicists have identified in the use of AI in health care, the most significant consideration ought not be vulnerabilities in the software, but the environmental impact of AI. Health care emits a significant amount of carbon in many countries. As AI becomes an essential part of health care, ethical reflection must include the potential to negatively impact the environment. As such, this article will first overview the carbon emissions in health care. It will, second, offer five reasons why carbon calculations are insufficient to address sustainability in health care. Third, the article will derive normative concepts from the goals of medicine, the principles of biomedical ethics, and green bioethics—the very locus in which AI in health care sits—to propose health, justice, and resource conservation as criteria for sustainable AI in health care. In the fourth and final part of the article, examples of sustainable and unsustainable development and use of AI in health care will be evaluated through the three-fold lens of health, justice, and resource conservation.

Besides, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 underscores the urgency of ensuring a sustainable supply chain with novel technologies including Artificial Intelligence to decrease food loss, which has the potential of mitigating food waste. These new technologies can increase productivity, especially in perishable products of the supply chain by reducing expenses, increasing the accuracy of operations, accelerating processes, and decreasing the carbon footprint of food. Artificial intelligence techniques such as deep learning can be utilized in various sections of meat supply chain management––where highly perishable products like spoiled meat need to be separated from wholesome ones to prevent cross-contamination with food-borne pathogens. Therefore, to automate this process and prevent meat spoilage and/or improve meat shelf life which is crucial to consumer meat preferences and sustainable consumption, a classification model was trained by the DCNN and PSO algorithms with 100% accuracy, which discerns wholesome meat from spoiled ones. © 2022, The Author(s).','method',0,'meat supply chain management','means','SDGs','individual','snapshot','present','quantitative','Turkey','1896 meat images','Iran',0),('2-s2.0-85127551777','Green space areas are one of the key factors in people’s livelihoods. Their number and size have a significant impact on both the environment and people’s quality of life, including their health. Accordingly, government agencies often rely on information relating to green space areas when devising suitable plans and mandating necessary regulations. At present, obtaining information on green space areas using conventional ground surveys faces a number of limitations. This approach not only requires a lengthy period, but also tremendous human and financial resources. Given such restrictions, the status of a green space is not always up to date. Although software applications, especially those based on geographical information systems and remote sensing, have increasingly been applied to these tasks, the capability to use crowdsourcing data and produce real-time reports is lacking. This is partly because the quantity of data required has, to date, prohibited effective verification by human operators. To address this issue, this paper proposes a novel geo-spatial platform for green space area management by means of GIS and artificial intelligence. In the proposed system, all user-submitted data are automatically verified by deep learning classification and analyses of the greenness areas on satellite imagery. The experimental results showed that the classification and analyses can identify green space areas at accuracies of 93.50% and 97.50%, re-spectively. To elucidate the merits of the proposed approach, web-based application software was implemented to demonstrate multimodal data management, cleansing, and reporting. This geospa-tial system was thus proven to be a viable tool for assisting governmental agencies to devise appro-priate plans toward sustainable development goals. © 2022 by the authors.

However, sustainability is not tantamount to the reduction of environmental costs. By shifting the focus to intergenerational justice as one of the constitutive normative pillars of sustainability, the paper identifies a reductionist view on the sustainability of AI and constructively contributes a conceptual extension. It further develops a framework that establishes normative issues of intergenerational justice raised by the uses of AI. The framework reveals how using AI for decision support to policies with long-term impacts can negatively affect future persons. In particular, the analysis demonstrates that uses of AI for decision support to policies of environmental protection or climate mitigation include assumptions about social discounting and future persons’ preferences. These assumptions are highly controversial and have a significant influence on the weight assigned to the potentially detrimental impacts of a policy on future persons. Furthermore, these underlying assumptions are seldom transparent within AI. Subsequently, the analysis provides a list of assessment questions that constitutes a guideline for the revision of AI techniques in this regard. In so doing, insights about how AI can be made more sustainable become apparent. © 2022 by the author.

It is among the prominent countries in the world, famous for surplus production of crops. Agriculture and the related activities are the main source of livelihood and income for more than 70% of the population of India. It plays a vital role in the economic growth of the country by contributing to around 14 to 15 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). India has a strong backbone in the Indian economy due to the significant contributions made by the farmers. Modern-day advancements have left an indelible imprint on the agriculture pattern of the country. It is due to the negligence of people which results in the deterioration of the harvest yield. In this work an Artificial Intelligent approach on harvest yield is performed to assess various factors affecting the yield of the crops in Tamil-Nadu state between the years 2000 to 2015, which primarily include: rainfall patterns to recommend different crops based on Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity and pH values of soil. A comparative analysis is performed on various supervised learning algorithms. XGBoost model for suggesting crop harvest based on parameters affecting soil quality is deployed, providing an overall test accuracy of 99.318%, outperformed other discussed techniques like DT, Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB), SVM and other similar types of supervised models.

Air pollution, especially PM2.5 resulting from industrialization, has fostered a wave of global weather migration and jeopardized human health in the past three decades. Taiwan has evolved as a highly developed economy and has a severe PM2.5 pollution problem. Thus, the control of PM2.5 is a critical issue for regulators, practitioners and academics. More recently, GA-SVM, an artificial-intelligence-based approach, has become a preferred prediction model, attributed to the advances in computer technology. However, hourly observation of PM2.5 concentration tends to present the GARCH effect. The objective of this study is to explore whether the integration of GA-SVM with the GARCH model can build a more accurate air pollution prediction model. The study adopts central Taiwan, the region with the worst level of PM2.5, as the source of observations. The empirical implementation of this study took a two-step approach; first, we examined the potential existence of the GARCH effect on the observed PM2.5 data. Second, we built a GA-SVM model integrated with the GARCH framework to predict the 8 h PM2.5 concentration of the sample region. The empirical results indicate that the prediction performance of our proposed alternative model out-performed the traditional SVM and GA-SVM models in terms of both MAPE and RMSE. The find-ings in this study provide evidence to support our expectation that adopting the SVM-based approach model for PM2.5 prediction is appropriate, and that prediction performance can be improved by integrating the GARCH model. Moreover, consistent with our prior expectation, the evidence further supports that taking the GARCH effect into account in the GA-SVM model significantly improves the accuracy of prediction. To the knowledge of the authors, this study is the first to at-tempt to integrate the GARCH effect into the GA-SVM model in the prediction of PM2.5. In sum-mary, with regard to the development of sustainability for both regulators and practitioners, our results strongly encourage them to take the GARCH effect into consideration in air pollution prediction if a regression-based model is to be adopted. Furthermore, this study may shed light on the application of the GARCH model and SVM models in the air pollution prediction literature. © 2022 by the authors.

Different from the conventional direct measurement based approach of acquiring a building\'s EPC label, this study proposes a novel and alternative approach to classify a building\'s EPC label using artificial neural network (ANN) models. Given the extensive best building EPC practices in developed countries, historical building EPC data and experiences can expedite the development and improvement of this procedure in developing countries. This study first develops the ANN classification model to attain the building EPC label.

There are already growing efforts to encourage people to engage more actively in sustainable environmental behavior, so-called “green nudging”. Nudging in general is a widespread policymaking tool designed to influence people’s behavior while preserving their freedom of choice. Given the enormous challenges humanity is facing in fighting climate change, the question naturally arises: Why not combine the power of AI and the effectiveness of nudging to get people to behave in more climate-friendly ways? However, nudging has been highly controversial from the very beginning because critics fear it undermines autonomy and democracy. In this article I investigate the ethics of AI-powered climate nudging and address the question whether implementing corresponding policies may represent hidden and unacceptable costs of AI in the form of a substantive damage to autonomy and democracy. I will argue that, although there are perfectly legitimate concerns and objections against certain forms of nudging, AI-powered climate nudging can be ethically permissible under certain conditions, namely if the nudging practice takes the form of what I will call “self-governance”. © 2022 by the author.

Transportation, security, energy, education, the workplace, the government have all incorporated AI into their infrastructures for enhancement and/or protection. In this paper, we argue that not only is AI seen as a tool for augmenting existing infrastructures, but AI itself is becoming an infrastructure that many services of today and tomorrow will depend upon. Considering the vast environmental consequences associated with the development and use of AI, of which the world is only starting to learn, the necessity of addressing AI alongside the concept of infrastructure points toward the phenomenon of carbon lock-in. Carbon lock-in refers to society’s constrained ability to reduce carbon emissions technologically, economically, politically, and socially. These constraints are due to the inherent inertia created by entrenched technological, institutional, and behavioral norms. That is, the drive for AI adoption in virtually every sector of society will create dependencies and interdependencies from which it will be hard to escape. The crux of this paper boils down to this: in conceptualizing AI as infrastructure we can recognize the risk of lock-in, not just carbon lock-in but lock-in as it relates to all the physical needs to achieve the infrastructure of AI. This does not exclude the possibility of solutions arising with the rise of these technologies; however, given these points, it is of the utmost importance that we ask inconvenient questions regarding these environmental costs before becoming locked into this new AI infrastructure. © 2022 by the authors.

In recent years, there has been increasing emphasis on resource recovery (reusing, recycling and extracting energy from waste) using more advanced approaches such as artificial intelligence (AI) in Australia. AI is a powerful technology that is increasingly gaining popularity and application in various fields. The adoption of AI techniques offers alternative innovative approaches to solid waste management (SWM). Although there are previous studies on AI technologies and SWM, no study has assessed the adoption of AI applications in solving the diverse SWM problems for achieving sustainable waste management in Australia. Moreover, there are inconsistencies and a lack of awareness on how AI technologies function in relation to their application to SWM. This study examines the application of AI technologies in various areas of SWM (generation, sorting, collection, vehicle routing, treatment, disposal and waste management planning) to enhance sustainable waste management practices in Australia. To achieve the aims of this study, prior studies from 2005 to 2021 from various databases are collected and analyzed. The study focuses on the adoption of AI applications on SWM, compares the performance of AI applications, explores the benefits and challenges, and provides best practice recommendations on how resource efficiency can be optimized to improve economic, environmental and social outcomes. This study found that AI-based models have better prediction abilities when compared to other models used in forecasting solid waste generation and recycling. Findings show that waste generation in Australia has been steadily increasing and requires upgraded and improved recovery infrastructure and the appropriate adoption of AI technologies to enhance sustainable SWM. Australia\'s adoption of AI recycling technologies would benefit from a national approach that seeks consistency across jurisdictions, while catering for regional differences.

This is because the confluence of these fields, whose methodologies have experienced explosive growth in the last few years, promises to solve some of the more challenging problems in sustainable and healthy nutrition, i.e., integrating food and behavioral-based dietary guidelines. Focusing here primarily on nutrition and health, we discuss what kind of methodological shift is needed to open current disciplinary borders to the methods, languages, and knowledge of the digital era and a system thinking approach. Specifically, we advocate for the adoption of interdisciplinary, complex-systems-based research to tackle the huge challenge of dealing with an evolving interdependent system in which there are multiple scales—from the metabolome to the population level—, heterogeneous and—more often than not— incomplete data, and population changes subject to many behavioral and environmental pressures. To illustrate the importance of this methodological innovation we focus on the consumption aspects of nutrition rather than production, but we recognize the importance of system-wide studies that involve both these components of nutrition. We round off the paper by outlining some specific research directions that would make it possible to find new correlations and, possibly, causal relationships across scales and to answer pressing questions in the area of sustainable and healthy nutrition.

It focuses on current research trends, and elaborates on gaps and directions for future research. Methods: A systematic literature review was conducted to identify current research and applications of LCA in buildings. The proposed review methodology includes (i) identifying recent authoritative research publications using established search engines, (ii) screening and retaining relevant publications, and (iii) extracting relevant LCA applications for buildings and analyzing their underpinning research. Subsequently, several research gaps and limitations were identified, which have informed our proposed future research directions. Results and discussions: This paper argues that humans can attenuate and positively control the impact of their buildings on the environment, and as such mitigate the effects of climate change. This can be achieved by a new generation of LCA methods and tools that are model based and continuously learn from real-time data, while informing effective operation and management strategies of buildings and districts. Therefore, the consideration of the time dimension in product system modeling is becoming essential to understand the resulting pollutant emissions and resource consumption. This time dimension is currently missing in life cycle inventory databases. A further combination of life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) models using time-dependent characterization factors can lead to more comprehensive and reliable LCA results. Conclusions and recommendations: This paper promotes the concept of semantic-based dynamic (real-time) LCA, which addresses temporal and spatial variations in the local built and environmental ecosystem, and thus more effectively promotes a “cradle-to-grave-to-reincarnation” environmental sustainability capability.

Water surveillance and monitoring, circular economy and sustainability, automation pyramid, digital transformation, artificial intelligence, data pipeline, digital twin, data mining, and data-driven visualization, cyber-physical systems and water-energy-health management were reviewed. The deployment of the digital systems has evidently proven to bridges the gap between the data-driven soft sensor, operation and control systems in WWTP. Accurate prediction of the WWTP variables can support process design and control, reduce operation cost, improve system reliability, predictive maintenance and troubleshooting, increase water quality, increase stakeholder\'s engagement and endorse optimization of the plant performance. This procures the best compliance with international standards and diversification. The inclusion of life cycle environmental or cost management technologies in optimization models is an interesting pathway towards sustainable water treatment in-line with sustainable development goals, circular bioeconomy and industry 4.0. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd','study object',0,'review of sustainable circularity and intelligent data-driven operations and control of the wastewater treatment plant','means','implicit: three dimensions of sustainability (economic, social, ecological)',NULL,'snapshot','present',NULL,NULL,NULL,'South Africa',0),('2-s2.0-85129974058','Contemporary agricultural systems are poised to transition from linear to circular, adopting concepts of recycling, repurposing, and regeneration. This transition will require changing crop improvement objectives to consider the entire system, and thus provide solutions to improve complex systems for higher productivity, resource use efficiency, and environmental quality. The methods and approaches that underpinned the doubling of yields during the last century may no longer be fully adequate to target crop improvement for circular agricultural systems. Here we propose a multidimensional framework for prediction with outcomes useful to assess both crop performance traits and environmental sustainability of the designed agricultural systems. The study focuses on maize harvestable grain yield and total carbon production, water use, and use efficiency for yield and carbon. The framework builds on the crop growth model whole genome prediction system, which is enabled by advanced phenomics and the integration of symbolic and sub-symbolic artificial intelligence. We demonstrate the approach and prediction accuracy advantages over a standard statistical genomic prediction approach used to breed maize hybrids for yield, flowering time, and kernel set using a dataset comprised of 7004 hybrids, 103 breeding populations, and 62 environments resulting from six years of experimentation in maize drought breeding in the U.S. We propose this framework to motivate a dialogue for how to enable circularity in agriculture through prediction-based systems design. © 2022 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.','method',0,'Precision agriculture','end',NULL,'national','longitudinal','future','quantitative','multiple','Field experiments','United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85130025937','Smart grids (SG) are electricity grids that communicate with each other, provide reliable information, and enable administrators to operate energy supplies across the country, ensuring optimized reliability and efficiency. The smart grid contains sensors that measure and transmit data to adjust the flow of electricity automatically based on supply/demand, and thus, responding to problems becomes quicker and easier. This also plays a crucial role in controlling carbon emissions, by avoiding energy losses during peak load hours and ensuring optimal energy management. The scope of big data analytics in smart grids is huge, as they collect information from raw data and derive intelligent information from the same. However, these benefits of the smart grid are dependent on the active and voluntary participation of the consumers in real-time. Consumers need to be motivated and conscious to avail themselves of the achievable benefits. Incentivizing the appropriate actor is an absolute necessity to encourage prosumers to generate renewable energy sources (RES) and motivate industries to establish plants that support sustainable and green-energy-based processes or products. The current study emphasizes similar aspects and presents a comprehensive survey of the start-of-the-art contributions pertinent to incentive mechanisms in smart grids, which can be used in smart grids to optimize the power distribution during peak times and also reduce carbon emissions. The various technologies, such as game theory, blockchain, and artificial intelligence, used in implementing incentive mechanisms in smart grids are discussed, followed by different incentive projects being implemented across the globe. The lessons learnt, challenges faced in such implementations, and open issues such as data quality, privacy, security, and pricing related to incentive mechanisms in SG are identified to guide the future scope of research in this sector. © 2022 by the authors.

Universal health coverage (UHC) proposes access to high-quality, affordable primary healthcare for all. The 17 UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are expected to be executed and achieved by all the 193 countries through national sustainable development strategies and multi-stakeholder partnerships. This article addresses SDG 3.8—access to good quality and affordable healthcare and two subindicators related to societal impact (SDG 3.8.1 and 3.8.2) through two objectives. The first objective is to determine whether health expenditure indicators (HEIs) drive UHC, and the second objective is to analyze the importance of key determinants and their interactions with UHC in three economic blocks: emerging Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC); developing Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa (BRICS) vis-à-vis the developed Australia, UK, and USA (AUKUS). We use the WHO Global Health Indicator database and UHC periodical surveys to evaluate the hypotheses. We apply state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) models and ordinary least square (traditional—OLS regression) methods to see the superiority of artificial intelligence (AI) over traditional ones. The ML Random Forest Tree method is found to be superior to the OLS model in terms of lower root mean square error (RMSE). The ML results indicate that domestic private health expenditure (PVT-D), out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPS) per Capita in US dollars, and voluntary health insurance (VHI) as a percentage of current health expenditure (CHE) are the key factors influencing UHC across the three economic blocks. Our findings have implications for drafting health and finance sector public policies, such as providing affordable social health insurance to the weaker sections of the population, making insurance premiums less expensive and affordable for the masses, and designing healthcare financing policies that are beneficial to the masses. UHC is an important determinant of health for all and requires an in-depth analysis of related factors. Policymakers are often faced with the challenge of prioritizing the economic needs of sectors such as education and food safety, making it difficult for healthcare to receive its due share. In this context, this article attempts to identify the key components that may influence the attainment of UHC and enable policy changes to address them more effectively and efficiently.

Among degradation processes, soil sealing represents the major threat, as ecosystem services dramatically decrease or are even nullified. The increasing use of big open data from satellites combined with AI algorithms are making geodata mining and mapping techniques essential to quantify soil sealing. Different keywords are adopted to define the phenomenon. However, at present, review articles presenting the state-of-the-art on mapping soil sealing by including the most common definitions are currently not available. Hence, we analyzed: (a) impervious surface, (b) soil sealing, (c) land take, (d) soil consumption, (e) land consumption. We provide a systematic review of remote sensing platforms and methodologies to map and to classify soil sealing, by highlighting: (a) definitions; (b) relationships among study areas, scales, platforms, resolutions, and classification methodologies; (c) emerging trends and policy implications. We performed a systematic search on Scopus (from 2000 to 2020), identifying 1277 papers; 392 focused on mapping soil sealing. \'Impervious surface\' is the dominant definition. The phenomenon is more studied by the USA, China and Italy and, \'soil sealing\' is recently more adopted in EU. Most studies focuses on mapping soil sealing at urban scale. We found Landsat are the most adopted platforms; they are frequently used for multi-temporal analyses. Eleven methodologies were identified: automatic classifications are the most adopted, dominated by pixel/sub-pixel-based approaches; other methods include Band Ratios, Supervised, OBIA, ANN. The majority of mapping analyses are performed on 30 m resolution in areas of 1000-10 000 km2. Landsat images are less used for smaller areas. In conclusion, as study area size increases, a decrease in image resolution with the use of more completely automatic classification methodologies is recorded. However, most studies focuses on comparing classification techniques rather than supporting policy making for sustainable urban planning. Thus, we encourage to fill the gap by developing approaches that applicable to international policies. © 2022 The Author(s).

The survey let them provide their knowledge of AI or their perceptions of the difficulties and opportunities of these technologies in HEIs. Our study discovered how difficulties and opportunities associated with AI impact HEIs. This study aims to see how AI might assist higher education in Romania and Serbia.

We consider that the personalized approach of the therapeutic intervention was the main difficulty. In this article, we propose a solution to this problem, an approach based on a platform initially developed by tactileimages.org for vision-impaired pupils which became a tool in the universal design of learning materials. This e-learning tool includes an Editor, a browser-based software developed to allow the creation or adaptation of drawings into vector images; the QR code through which areas of educational and therapeutic interest are allocated to pictures for task personalization; and the voice-over function of the companion application. The customized material is identified by image recognition algorithms, and the user\'s gesture is recognized by artificial intelligence algorithms, which receives (by voice-over) details about therapeutic tasks in remote teaching. The article illustrates the personalization of the therapeutic and educational path. The process starts with defining the child\'s functioning profile and matching function with the curriculum elements as they are found within the Erasmus + project “Cognitive Resources for Toddlers Teens and Experts” —stored in the virtual library.

Quantum computing (QC) has the potential to revolutionize various domains of science and engineering, including macro-energy systems and sustainable energy materials design. Conventional approaches for renewable and sustainable energy systems solely rely on classical computing techniques that may not scale well with the increasing size and complexity of applications. Owing to the advancements in quantum hardware and algorithms, QC and quantum artificial intelligence make promising tools to handle renewable and sustainable energy systems even at larger scales. In this review, we discuss the prospects of QC for various areas of applications in energy sustainability to help address climate change. In addition to providing a brief background on the operations of quantum computers, the constituent segments of widely adopted QC-based techniques that improve the computational efficiency of quantum chemistry calculations for sustainable energy materials along with quantum artificial intelligence methods that can address complex optimization and machine learning problems arising in renewable energy systems are also introduced in this paper.

Brazil has a universal public health system (Sistema Unico de Saúde—SUS), being the main source of care for 75% of the population. Therefore, a saturation of the system was foreseen with the continuous increase of cases. The use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to empower telehealth could help to tackle this by increasing a coordinated patient access to the health system. In the present study we describe a descriptive case report analyzing the use of Laura Digital Emergency Room—an AI-powered telehealth platform—in three different cities. It was computed around 130,000 interactions made by the chatbot and 24,162 patients completed the digital triage. Almost half (44.8%) of the patients were classified as having mild symptoms, 33.6% were classified as moderate and only 14.2% were classified as severe. The implementation of an AI-powered telehealth to increase accessibility while maintaining safety and leveraging value amid the unprecedent impact of the COVID-19 pandemic was feasible in Brazil and may reduce healthcare overload.

Smart greenhouse development is even more important to overcome these limitations and achieve high levels of food security. While the main aim of greenhouses is to offer an appropriate environment for high-yield production while protecting crops from adverse climate conditions, smart greenhouses provide precise regulation and control of the microclimate variables by utilizing the latest control techniques, advanced metering and communication infrastructures, and smart management systems thus providing the optimal environment for crop development. However, due to the development of information technology, greenhouses are undergoing a big transformation. In fact, the new generation of greenhouses has gone from simple constructions to sophisticated factories that drive agricultural production at the minimum possible cost. The main objective of this paper is to present a comprehensive understanding framework of the actual greenhouse development in Qatar, so as to be able to support the transition to sustainable precision agriculture. Qatar’s greenhouse market is a dynamic sector, and it is expected to mark double-digit growth by 2025. Thus, this study may offer effective supporting information to decision and policy makers, professionals, and end-users in introducing new technologies and taking advantage of monitoring techniques, artificial intelligence, and communication infrastructure in the agriculture sector by adopting smart greenhouses, consequently enhancing the Food-Energy-Water Nexus resilience and sustainable development.

One of the environmental issues which is air pollution has been catching attention among industrialists, researchers, and communities around the world. However, it has always neglected until the impacts on human health become worse, and at times, irreversible. Human exposure to air pollutant such as particulate matters, sulfur dioxide, ozone and carbon monoxide contributed to adverse health hazards which result in respiratory diseases, cardiorespiratory diseases, cancers, and worst, can lead to death. This has led to a spike increase of hospitalization and emergency department visits especially at areas with worse pollution cases that seriously impacting human life and health. To address this alarming issue, a predictive model of air pollution is crucial in assessing the impacts of health due to air pollution. It is also critical in predicting the air quality index when assessing the risk contributed by air pollutant exposure. Hence, this systemic review explores the existing studies on anticipating air quality impact to human health using the advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI). From the extensive review, we highlighted research gaps in this field that are worth to inquire. Our study proposes to develop an AI-based integrated environmental and health impact assessment system using federated learning. This is specifically aims to identify the association of health impact and pollution based on socio-economic activities and predict the Air Quality Index (AQI) for impact assessment. The output of the system will be utilized for hospitals and healthcare services management and planning. The proposed solution is expected to accommodate the needs of the critical and prioritization of sensitive group of publics during pollution seasons.

Moreover, cybersecurity, digital invoices, price transparency, improving patient experience, management of big data, and the need for a revised education are challenges in response to digital transformation. Indeed, forward-looking innovation about exponential technologies and their effect on healthcare is now gaining momentum. Thus, we developed a framework, followed by an online survey, to investigate key areas, analyze and visualize future-oriented developments concerning technologies and innovative business models while attempting to translate visions into a strategy toward healthcare democratization. When forecasting the future of health in a short and long-term perspective, results showed that digital healthcare, data management, electronics, and sensors were the most common predictions, followed by artificial intelligence in clinical diagnostic and in which hospitals and homes would be the places of primary care. Shifting from a reactive to a proactive digital ecosystem, the focus on prevention, quality, and faster care accessibility are the novel value propositions toward democratization and digitalization of patient-centered services. Longevity will translate into increased neurodegenerative, chronic diseases, and mental illnesses, becoming severe issues for a future healthcare setup. Besides, data privacy, big data management, and novel regulatory procedures were considered as potential problems resulting from digital transformation. However, a revised education is needed to address these issues while preparing future health professionals. The “P4 of health”, a novel business model that is outcome-based oriented, awareness and acceptance of technologies to support public health, a different mindset that is proactive and future-oriented, and an interdisciplinary setting to merge clinical and technological advances would be key to a novel healthcare ecosystem.

In this paper, optimized artificial intelligence models (e.g. multiple regressions (MR), hierarchical clusters (HCs), and artificial neural networks (ANNs)) for assessing and predicting the CSPs of water resources were developed, for Ojoto suburb (SE Nigeria). Indices used in evaluating the CSPs are chloride–sulphate mass ratio (CSMR), Larson-Skold index (LSI), Langelier index (LI), aggressive index (AI), Ryznar stability index (RSI), Puckorius scaling index (PSI), and Revelle index (RI). This work is the first of its kind to utilize predictive models in simultaneously predicting the industrial water quality indices. Prior to the predictive modeling, R-mode HCs, correlation, principal component, and factor analyses were used to analyze the relationships between the physicochemical variables (pH–T–EC–TDS–TH–Ca–HCO3–Cl–SO4–Fe–Zn–Pb) and the CSP indices. Q-mode HCs effectively identified the spatiotemporal water corrosion/scaling risk classification and distribution in the area. Both MR and ANN models suitably predicted the CSP indices. However, both models better predicted AI, LI, RSI and PSI than LSI, RI and CSMR. The MR models’ performances were analyzed using R, R2, adjusted R2 and F-ratio values whereas the ANN models were verified using parity plots, R2, RMSE, and residual error plots.

Given the projected population growth, sustainable agriculture must accomplish food security while also being economically viable, socially responsible, and having the least possible impact on biodiversity and natural ecosystems. Deep learning has shown to be a sophisticated approach for big data analysis, with several successful cases in image processing, object identification, and other domains. It has lately been applied in food science and engineering. Among the issues and concerns addressed by these systems were food recognition; quality detection of fruits, vegetables, meat, and aquatic items; food supply chain; and food contamination. In precision agriculture, Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a commonly used technology for estimating food quality. It is especially important when evaluating crops at different phases of harvest and postharvest. Crop disease and damage detection is a high-priority activity because some postharvest diseases or damages, such as decay, can destroy crops and produce poisons that are toxic to humans. In this paper, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)-based U-Net, DeepLab, and Mask R-CNN models to detect and predict postharvest deterioration zones in stored apple fruits. Our approach is unique in that it segmented and predicted postharvest decay and nondecay zones in fruits separately. This review will focus on postharvest physiology and management of fruits and vegetables, including harvesting, handling, packing, storage, and hygiene, to reduce postharvest loss (PHL) and improve crop quality. It will also cover postharvest handling under extreme weather conditions and potential impacts of climate change on vegetable postharvest and postharvest biotechnology on PHL. © 2022 Abha Singh et al.','method',0,'Reduce food waste','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Saudi Arabia',0),('2-s2.0-85132562544','Russian Federation; artificial intelligence; COVID-19; Internet; machine learning; smart city; sustainability; transportation system; urban planning','study object',0,'smart city; urban design and planning','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85132772726','Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the greatest contemporary threats to our planet’s social and economic well-being, accompanied by tremendous advances in education, health, economic growth, transportation, environmental sustainability and energy etc. Hence, there is an urgent need to control and govern AI.

These technologies enable services at significantly lower prices due to the effective use of energy and resources with lesser wastage. Manufacturers are constantly looking for methods to lower the operating expenses associated with production processes. Manufacturers might optimise their value chain\'s production and associated processes by adopting sustainability 4.0 technologies. Such technologies will help manufacturers select their optimal facilities and employees, lower operational costs, enhance productivity and resource utilisation and provide a picture of process gaps that can be addressed. Sustainability is based on the effective use and reuse of resources across the product life cycle, from materials and processes to equipment and skills. Sustainable manufacturing produces manufactured goods using economically viable procedures that reduce negative environmental consequences while preserving energy and natural resources.

It also aims to help in energy efficiency and saving in an ever-increasing energy crisis and dangerous levels of climate change. This paper evaluated the accuracy of room occupancy recognition using a dataset with di-verse amounts of light, CO2, and humidity.

There are considerable barriers to overcome, including the existing practices of technology education and teachers’ knowledge of AI. Research evidence shows that studying teachers’ experiences can be beneficial in informing how appropriate design in teaching sustainable AI should evolve. Design frames characterize teachers’ design reasoning and can substantially influence their AI lesson design considerations. This study examined 18 experienced teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI and identi-fied effective designs to support AI instruction. Data collection methods involved semi-structured interviews, action study, classroom observation, and post-lesson discussions with the purpose of analyzing the teachers’ perceptions of teaching AI. Grounded theory was employed to detail how teachers understand the pedagogical challenges of teaching AI and the emerging pedagogical solutions from their perspectives. Results reveal that effective AI instructional design should encompass five important components: (1) obstacles to and facilitators of participation in teaching AI, (2) interactive design thinking processes, (3) teachers’ knowledge of teaching AI, (4) orienteering AI knowledge for social good, and (5) the holistic understanding of teaching AI.

Scientific Reasoning, Critical Thinking, and the ability to debunk myths are already important competencies that can be fostered with science education. How can we approach the majority of seventh grade students in a given school to create innovative approaches for the future, and leverage their skills in science, art and (digital) technology along the path? And are the teachers ready to guide them on this path? This article focuses on the questions: how did the teachers adopt both the STEAM approach, and the use of digital tools while being supervised by researchers and student teachers and how did this change their beliefs about technology in education. As a pathway, we aimed to connect Robotics, Coding, Artificial Intelligence (AI) with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. To end poverty, protect the environment, and ensure that all people enjoy peace and prosperity by 2030, the SDGs are incorporated into national policies and school curricula. With this, citizens, teachers, and governments alike struggle with strategies on how these goals can be reached by 2030, facing the growing challenges in an ever increasingly complex and insecure world. It is clear that technology will take a dominant role in this development. Based on the STEAM paradigm and the 5E approach of the Biological Sciences Curriculum Study (BSCS), we have developed a pedagogical concept that encompasses both the technological aspects, AI and the SDGs. We tested this concept as part of an on-the-job teacher training project with 60 education science student teachers and 8 teachers in their classrooms, together with their 116 7th grade students and found out that STEAM-based projects with a sixth phase in addition to the 5E approach can be carried out promisingly with the help of digital creativity tools.

Light nuclei, such as deuterium and tritium, undergo a fusion reaction that releases energy, making fusion a promising option for a sustainable and clean energy source. Tokamak plasmas, however, are prone to disruptions as a result of a sudden collapse of the system terminating the fusion reactions. As disruptions lead to an abrupt loss of confinement, they can cause irreversible damage to present-day fusion devices and are expected to have a more devastating effect in future devices. Disruptions expected in the next-generation tokamak, ITER, for example, could cause electromagnetic forces larger than the weight of an Airbus A380. Furthermore, the thermal loads in such an event could exceed the melting threshold of the most resistant state-of-the-art materials by more than an order of magnitude.

This viewpoint article addresses how digital transformation can help support and meet expansion needs of the fisheries/aquaculture industries that includes exploiting and harnessing ICT, IoT, Cloud-edge computing, AI, machine learning, immersive technologies and blockchain. Digital technologies are bringing significant operational benefits for global food chain, improving efficiencies and productivity, reducing waste, contamination and food fraud. The focus on digital technologies has recently evolved to Industry 5.0 where AI and robotics are coupled with the human mind in order to advance human-centric solutions. This viewpoint describes the role of Quadruple helix Hub (academic-industry-government and society) in delivering a convergent holistic approach to meeting the diversity of fishery industry needs by connecting and placing fisheries centrally in a defined ecosystem of stakeholders. This includes specialist training, testing technologies, providing access to finance and fostering disruption through aquaculture accelerator initiatives such as that provided by Hatch Blue. Connecting digital Innovation Hubs trans-regionally, nationally and internationally will also help mitigate against significant risks for the fisheries and aquaculture industry including climate change, global pandemics and conflicts that can jeopardize fish and seafood production and supply chains.

Correspondingly, climate-smart crops are also the need to regulate biomass production, which is imperative for the maintenance of ecosystem services worldwide. Since conventional breeding technologies for crop improvement are limited, time-consuming, and involve laborious selection processes to foster new and improved crop varieties. An urgent need is to accelerate the plant breeding cycle using artificial intelligence (AI) to depict plant responses to environmental perturbations in real-time. Materials and methods: The review is a collection of authorized information from various sources such as journals, books, book chapters, technical bulletins, conference papers, and verified online contents. Conclusions: Speed breeding has emerged as an essential strategy for accelerating the breeding cycles of crop plants by growing them under artificial light and temperature conditions. Furthermore, speed breeding can also integrate marker-assisted selection and cutting-edged gene-editing tools for early selection and manipulation of essential crops with superior agronomic traits. Scientists have recently applied next-generation AI to delve deeper into the complex biological and molecular mechanisms that govern plant functions under environmental cues. In addition, AIs can integrate, assimilate, and analyze complex OMICS data sets, an essential prerequisite for successful speed breeding protocol implementation to breed crop plants with superior yield and adaptability. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.','study object',0,'Smart Farming','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'India',0),('2-s2.0-85135916650','Recent advancements and developments in artificial intelligence (AI) based approaches have shifted the manufacturing practices towards the fourth industrial revolution, considered as Industry 4.0 practices. A positive impact of AI-based techniques on sustainability can be seen in manufacturing organisations’ at the system, product and process levels. Adopting AI-based strategies in manufacturing improves decision making, productivity and system performance. Despite sustainability and other benefits, the adoption of AI-based approaches in manufacturing organisations is still limited due to employees’ knowledge and digital skills. In the present time, due to the digitalisation of manufacturing activities, intelligent sensors, and supply chain activities, industries are facing challenges with the generation of high volume, different variety and velocity of data. This data can be helpful for manufacturing organisations to enhance their performance and sustainability. However, managing this big data is still a significant challenge due to a lack of knowledge and limited literature. Deep learning (DL) based models can be a suitable choice to provide advanced analytics tools for manufacturing data processing and analysis. However, literature on the DL is still limited in the manufacturing context with its relationship to sustainability. The present study discusses the evolution of DL approaches in manufacturing and different DL-based models. This study also highlights how DL-based approaches can enhance the sustainability performance of industries.

Moreover, its commercialization can enable a jump start towards resolving energy and economic crisis. However, the major bottleneck in biorefinery includes (i) low biomass and biomolecules production, (ii) high cost, (iii) less economic viability, (iv) high energy requirement, and (v) environmental impacts of the process. Furthermore, the lack of advanced models or algorithms for process designing and limited genetic and molecular knowledge is a key bottleneck. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel integrated microalgal bioenergy conversion methods that provide economic and environmental balance. Moreover, advanced molecular knowledge in the microalgal research pipeline can be developed that improves the biosynthesis of biomolecules. Furthermore, novel technological development is required that automatically controls and monitors the microalgal biorefinery. Thus, the current review describes a comparative analysis of the gaps from previous studies. Subsequently, it highlights advanced cutting-edge cultivation and molecular and genetic approaches for enhancing biomass and biomolecules.

They have been promoted as technologies with tremendous potential for boosting economic growth and sustainability in all sectors of society – a claim whose validity remains underexplored. Building on systems thinking and the Multi-Level Perspective, we develop a novel approach to assess the socio-technical impact of a KET regime on a transitioning sectoral regime. This approach is applied to the case of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) KET impacting the decarbonization of the energy-intensive steel industry. To assess AI\'s technical impact, we compiled an inventory of AI tools based on reviewing technical scientific articles. Our analysis shows that AI adds technological value to the full range of areas in the steel industry, like predicting process parameters; optimizing operations, scheduling, and electrical energy; and forecasting product demand, quality, and site emissions. Semi-structured interviews were the primary data source to assess AI\'s broader socio-institutional impact. The results indicate that AI may currently be reinforcing path dependencies of the steel industry, as AI tools are more focused on incremental improvement for existing technologies rather than novel low-carbon technologies. However, AI also offers capabilities to reduce barriers to sustainability innovation, like system integration challenges, flexibility challenges, demand-side barriers, and risk-related barriers. Finally, we reflect on the generalizability of our approach for studying other transitions, and we induce characteristics of the AI-Digital KET regimes. We find that through these characteristics, the AI-Digital KET regime alters existing and creates new system structures (actors, networks, and institutions) within the impacted sector. © 2022 The Authors','study object',0,'Impact of AI on decarbonization of steel industry','end',NULL,NULL,'snapshot','present','qualitative',NULL,'Interviews','Netherlands',0),('2-s2.0-85136232370','The widespread popularity of renewable and sustainable sources of energy such as solar and wind calls for the integration of renewable energy sources into electrical power grids for sustainable development. Microgrids minimize power quality issues in the main grid by linking with an active filter and furnishing reactive power compensation, harmonic mitigation, and load balancing at the point of common coupling. The reliability issues faced by standalone DC microgrids can be managed by interlinking microgrids with a power grid. An artificial intelligence-based Icos (Formula presented.) control algorithm for power sharing and power quality improvement in smart microgrid systems is proposed here to render grid-integrated power systems more intelligent. The proposed controller considers various uncertainties caused by load variations, state of charge of the battery of microgrids, and power tariff based on the availability of power in microgrids. This paper presents a detailed analysis of the integration of wind and solar microgrids with the grid for dynamic power flow management in order to improve the power quality and to reduce the burden, thereby strengthening the central grid. A smart grid system with multiple smart microgrids coupled with a renewable energy source with tariff control and judicious power flow management was simulated for power-sharing and power quality improvement.

The carbon storage with the food security scenario could achieve 162.74 × 106 t in 2030. The carbon storage with the ecological protection scenario had an increase of 62.60 t/km2 compared to the historical natural tendency development. Interestingly, the food security scenario had the smallest carbon loss value which is about $1.39 × 109, and its net carbon storage value was the largest which is about $3.71 × 109.

Habitat mapping relies on seafloor classification typically based on acoustic methods, and ground truthing through direct sampling and optical imaging. With the increasing capabilities to record high-resolution underwater images, manual approaches for analyzing these images to create seafloor classifications are no longer feasible. Automated workflows have been proposed as a solution, in which algorithms assign pre-defined seafloor categories to each image. However, in order to provide consistent and repeatable analysis, these automated workflows need to address e.g., underwater illumination artefacts, variances in resolution and class-imbalances, which could bias the classification. Here, we present a generic implementation of an Automated and Integrated Seafloor Classification Workflow (AI-SCW). The workflow aims to classify the seafloor into habitat categories based on automated analysis of optical underwater images with only minimal amount of human annotations. AI-SCW incorporates laser point detection for scale determination and color normalization. It further includes semi-automatic generation of the training data set for fitting the seafloor classifier. As a case study, we applied the workflow to an example seafloor image dataset from the Belgian and German contract areas for Manganese-nodule exploration in the Pacific Ocean. Based on this, we provide seafloor classifications along the camera deployment tracks, and discuss results in the context of seafloor multibeam bathymetry. Our results show that the seafloor in the Belgian area predominantly comprises densely distributed nodules, which are intermingled with qualitatively larger-sized nodules at local elevations and within depressions.

It has, thus, now become essential to investigate the part of technology in the accomplishment of these Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), as this will enable us to circumvent any potential conflicts that may arise. The importance of wastewater management in the accomplishment of these goals has been highlighted in the study. The research focuses on the role of fourth industrial revolution in meeting the Sustainable Goals for 2030. Given that water is the most important resource on the planet and since 11 of the 17 Sustainable Goals are directly related to having access to clean water, effective water management is the most fundamental need for achieving these goals. The age of Industry 4.0 has ushered in a variety of new solutions in many industrial sectors, including manufacturing, water, energy, healthcare, and electronics. This paper examines the present creative solutions in water treatment from an Industry-4.0 viewpoint, focusing on big data, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and several other technologies. The study has correlated the various concepts of Industry 4.0 along with water and wastewater management and also discusses the prior work carried out in this field with help of different technologies.

However, several issues prevent the application of storage projects on a global scale. An accurate estimation of the delivered amount of natural gas from each storage site might be used for supply and demand. Due to this fact, this study proposed hybrid intelligent models integrating the least square support vector machine (LSSVM), differential evolution (DE), imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA), cultural algorithm (CA), teaching learning-based optimization (TLBO), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) for approximating the deliverability of underground natural gas storage in different geological formations. We have employed vast data sets of 782 reservoirs from depleted fields to train and validate the proposed intelligent models to predict underground natural gas storage deliverability in the USA. The visual and analytical assessments were used to investigate the performance of the developed intelligent systems. The predicted results showed that all of the intelligent models agreed with the recorded data. Moreover, the statistical indicators revealed that the LSSVM coupling TLBO model shows the highest accuracy in predicting the deliverability of natural gas storage in the depleted field among three intelligent models. Also, the optimal intelligent model accurately predicts 880 and 600 data measurements of saline aquifers and salt domes, respectively. The optimal intelligent model yields a root mean square error (RMSE) value of less than 0.022. The correlation factor (R2) is over 0.998, 0.999, and 0.906 for the depleted field, saline aquifers, and salt domes, respectively. The results highlight the importance of combining smart approaches with nature-inspired strategies in forecasting storage site deliverability. In light of these findings, researchers are better equipped to reduce petroleum energy usage and increase community acceptability of natural gas as part of the transition to green energy. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd','method',0,'Deliverability of underground natural gas','means','Paris Climate Agreement','national','snapshot','past; present','quantitative','United States of America','datasets of 782 reservoirs from depleted gas natural fields taken from Energy Information Administration','South South Korea',0),('2-s2.0-85139416578','Water distribution systems are one of the critical infrastructures and major assets of the water utility in a nation. The infrastructure of the distribution systems consists of resources, treatment plants, reservoirs, distribution lines, and consumers. A sustainable water distribution network management has to take care of accessibility, quality, quantity, and reliability of water. As water is becoming a depleting resource for the coming decades, the regulation and accounting of water in terms of the above four parameters is a critical task. There have been many efforts towards the establishment of a monitoring and controlling framework, capable of automating various stages of the water distribution processes. The current trending technologies such as Information and Communication Technology (ICT), Internet of Things (IoT), and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have the potential to track this spatially varying network to collect, process, and analyze the water distribution network attributes and events. In this work, we investigate the role and scope of the IoT technologies in different stages of the water distribution systems. Our survey covers the state-of-the-art monitoring and control systems for the water distribution networks, and the status of IoT architectures for water distribution networks. We explore the existing water distribution systems, providing the necessary background information on the current status.

LAC countries occupy 13% of the Earths landmass yet contain 60% of the terrestrial life. The region is particularly brittle as climate change looms on the horizon, and its economic reliance on exploiting natural resources is accelerating its biodiversity loss. Central to these problems is that LAC is the most economically unequal region globally. Thus, it faces unique challenges in promoting sustainable development. This paper explores whether and how Artificial Intelligence (AI) may provide methods to accelerate the changes needed to increase resilience and facilitate adaptation. Starting with a systematic mapping of the research on AI for sustainability in LAC, we present a diagnosis of the current situation structured along the proposed axes of climate change, human vulnerability, and biodiversity. Then, we give some illustrative examples of potential directions for further work with applicability to the region.

With the continuous advance of observation technology, ocean science has entered the era of big data which significantly facilitates its junction with artificial intelligence (AI). This paper aims to answer the question “can AI serve as a new bridge from oceanic data to knowledge?” by summarizing a large number of investigations and implementing experiments of application examples. First, the AI frameworks of features engineering, classification, and detection, as well as time series forecasting that explores the emerging AI oceanography, are systematically deliberated; Then several case studies with different depths of the ocean are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of these new data-to-knowledge bridges, including ocean current reconstruction, Arctic sea ice prediction, oceanic eddy identification with profiling data, and deep-sea debris detection for oceanic ecology; Finally, recommendations to strengthen the ocean AI in several typical application areas are proposed. Consensus has been reached that big data science is one of the most dynamic branches in interdisciplinary fields, of which deep blue AI (DBAI) might be one of the most universal methodologies. Consequently, the potential of DBAI needs to be widely and urgently explored and revealed. Taking advantage of exponentially increasing big ocean data, it is highly anticipated that many oceanography problems will be successfully solved by using AI-based knowledge discovery methodologies, through which the DBAI technology itself will be significantly advanced. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd','study object',0,'deep blue artificial intelligence','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'China',0),('2-s2.0-85139867315','Kosice; Kosicky; Slovakia; Blending; Environmental management; Iterative methods; Radiation effects; Shape optimization; Solar radiation; Sustainable development; Design strategies; Optimisations; Parametric architecture; Performative designs; Real- time; Real-time sun analyse; Real-time wind analyse; Shape-optimization; Wind analysis; artificial intelligence; climate change; computational fluid dynamics; computer simulation; optimization; real time; solar radiation; weather; Computational fluid dynamics','method',0,'Developing cities in a climate friendly way with the help of AI','means',NULL,'local','snapshot','present','quantitative','Slovakia','*epw EnergyPlus weather file','Slovakia',0),('2-s2.0-85139873811','Global food security, which has emerged as one of the sustainability challenges, impacts every country. As food cannot be generated without involving nutrients, research has intensified recently to recover unused nutrients from waste streams. As a finite resource, phosphorus (P) is largely wasted. This work critically reviews the technical applicability of various water technologies to recover macro-nutrients such as P, N, and K from wastewater. Struvite precipitation, adsorption, ion exchange, and membrane filtration are applied for nutrient recovery. Technological strengths and drawbacks in their applications are evaluated and compared. Their operational conditions such as pH, dose required, initial nutrient concentration, and treatment performance are presented. Cost-effectiveness of the technologies for P or N recovery is also elaborated. It is evident from a literature survey of 310 published studies (1985–2022) that no single technique can effectively and universally recover target macro-nutrients from liquid waste. Struvite precipitation is commonly used to recover over 95 % of P from sludge digestate with its concentration ranging from 200 to 4000 mg/L. The recovered precipitate can be reused as a fertilizer due to its high content of P and N. Phosphate removal of higher than 80 % can be achieved by struvite precipitation when the molar ratio of Mg2+/PO43− ranges between 1.1 and 1.3. The applications of artificial intelligence (AI) to collect data on critical parameters control optimization, improve treatment effectiveness, and facilitate water utilities to upscale water treatment plants. Such infrastructure in the plants could enable the recovered materials to be reused to sustain food security. As nutrient recovery is crucial in wastewater treatment, water treatment plant operators need to consider (1) the costs of nutrient recovery techniques; (2) their applicability; (3) their benefits and implications. It is essential to note that the treatment cost of P and/or N-laden wastewater depends on the process applied and local conditions. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.','study object',0,'Food security','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'Poland',1),('2-s2.0-85139943500',NULL,'study object',1,'Ethical AI for the gouvernmentality of climate change','end','SDGs',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'France',0),('2-s2.0-85139944328','To improve the quality of mathematics learning for high school students in economically disadvantaged areas, and promote education equity and sustainable development, this study developed the Mathematics Learning Strategies Intelligent Assessment and Strategy Implementation System by using artificial intelligence technology. The system fuses assessment scales, a set of norms, improvement strategies, and the intelligent assessment and strategy implementation program into an organic whole. The system can intelligently output all participants’ diagnosis results of the mathematics learning strategy in batches and automatically propose targeted improvement strategies for every participant. By applying the intelligent system to Jianzha County, Huangnan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Qinghai Province, China, the results show that the mathematical learning strategies of high school students in Jianzha County were at a middle level; mathematical cognitive strategies and mathematical resource-management strategies need to be improved. The system’s effectiveness in practical applications was later tested via both quantitative methods, such as questionnaire surveys and testing, and qualitative methods, such as interviews, as well as evaluation by self and others. By intervening with participants according to the strategy implementation program provided by the system, it was found that their mathematics learning strategy level improved. The results of the study show that the system can accurately diagnose the level of mathematics learning strategies of high school students and that interventions based on the improvement measures can improve students’ mathematics learning strategy and mathematics achievements, indicating that the system is effective. © 2022 by the authors.','study object',0,'Intelligent Asssessment System for Mathematics Learning Strategy among High School Students','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','present','mixed','China','norm of mathematics learning strategies for high school students in Tianjin (private)','China',0),('2-s2.0-85139949932','In light of fast-growing popular, political and professional discourses around AI in education, this article outlines five broad areas of contention that merit closer attention in future discussion and decision-making.

Cement production plants are one of the extremest CO2 emissions, and the rotary kiln is a cement plant’s most energy-consuming and energy-wasting unit. Thus, enhancing its operation assessments adsorb attention. Since many factors would affect the clinker production quality and rotary kiln efficiency, controlling those variables is beyond operator capabilities. Constructing a conscious-lab “CL” (developing an explainable artificial intelligence “EAI” model based on the industrial operating dataset) can potentially tackle those critical issues, reduce laboratory costs, save time, improve process maintenance and help for better training operators. As a novel approach, this investigation examined extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) coupled with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) “SHAP-XGBoost” for the modeling and prediction of the rotary kiln factors (feed rate and induced draft fan current) based on over 3,000 records collected from the Ilam cement plant. SHAP illustrated the relationships between each record and variables with the rotary kiln factors, demonstrated their correlation magnitude, and ranked them based on their importance. XGBoost accurately (R-square 0.96) could predict the rotary kiln factors where results showed higher exactness than typical EAI models. © 2022 The Author(s).

Water harvesting and recycling are the major requirements to meet the global upcoming demand of the water crisis, which is prevalent. To achieve this, we need more emphasis on water management techniques that are applied across various categories of the applications. Keeping in mind the population density index, there is a dire need to implement intelligent water management mechanisms for effective distribution, conservation and to maintain the water quality standards for various purposes. The prescribed work discusses about few major areas of applications that are required for efficient water management. Those are recent trends in wastewater recycle, water distribution, rainwater harvesting and irrigation management using various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. The data acquired for these applications are purely unique and also differs by type. Hence, there is a dire need to use a model or algorithm that can be applied to provide solutions across all these applications.

Worldwide, OCs have been rolled out in primary care rapidly owing to policy initiatives and COVID-19. There is a lack of evidence regarding how OC design and implementation influence care quality. Objective: We aimed to synthesize research on the impacts of OCs on primary care quality, and how these are influenced by system design and implementation. Methods: We searched databases from January 2010 to February 2022. We included quantitative and qualitative studies of real-world OC use in primary care. Quantitative data were transformed into qualitative themes. We used thematic synthesis informed by the Institute of Medicine domains of health care quality, and framework analysis informed by the nonadoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, and sustainability framework. Strength of evidence was judged using the GRADE-CERQual approach. Results: We synthesized 63 studies from 9 countries covering 31 OC systems, 14 (22%) of which used artificial intelligence; 41% (26/63) of studies were published from 2020 onward, and 17% (11/63) were published after the COVID-19 pandemic. There was no quantitative evidence for negative impacts of OCs on patient safety, and qualitative studies suggested varied perceptions of their safety. Some participants believed OCs improved safety, particularly when patients could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload decreased when sufficient resources were allocated to implement OCs and patients used them for simple problems or could describe their queries using free text. Staff workload increased when OCs were not integrated with other software or organizational workflows and patients used them for complex queries. OC systems that required patients to describe their queries using multiple-choice questionnaires increased workload for patients and staff. Health costs decreased when patients used OCs for simple queries and increased when patients used them for complex queries. Patients using OCs were more likely to be female, younger, and native speakers, with higher socioeconomic status. OCs increased primary care access for patients with mental health conditions, verbal communication difficulties, and barriers to attending in-person appointments. Access also increased by providing a timely response to patients’ queries. Patient satisfaction increased when using OCs owing to better primary care access, although it decreased when using multiple-choice questionnaire formats. Conclusions: This is the first theoretically informed synthesis of research on OCs in primary care and includes studies conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It contributes new knowledge that, in addition to having positive impacts on care quality such as increased access, OCs also have negative impacts such as increased workload. Negative impacts can be mitigated through appropriate OC system design (eg, free text format), incorporation of advanced technologies (eg, artificial intelligence), and integration into technical infrastructure (eg, software) and organizational workflows (eg, timely responses). © Sarah Darley, Tessa Coulson, Niels Peek, Susan Moschogianis, Sabine N van der Veer, David C Wong, Benjamin C Brown.','study object',0,'Medical online consultation','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'qualitative',NULL,NULL,'United Kingdom',0),('2-s2.0-85140768946','In recovering from one of the worst educational crises in recorded history due to the pandemic, in a mission to rebuild and become more resilient, there has been a heightened urgency to provide resources to communities most in need. However, precisely identifying those needs have become all the more important due to the increase in popularity of e-learning as a suitable option and the improvement of technologies. Most notably, socially disadvantaged and historically marginalized communities were disproportionately and severely impacted by several aspects of the pandemic, in terms of health, economics, access to education, and sustainable well-being. This differential effect was modeled spatially with the combination of aerial photogrammetry, traditional geospatial mapping, and other robust AI-driven techniques to synthesize and analyze the various types of data. In this original research study, we apply various spatial health variables, relate them to educational variables in an initial empirical process of understanding how to address equity-related considerations from the context of the learner’s experience, providing the empirical evidence for the development of locally tailored learner support and assistance, meeting students where they are by specifically identifying and targetting geographically underserved areas. We found that there were clear statistically significant relationships between educational attainment and several physical (p < 0.001), mental (p = 0.003), access to healthy food/food security (p < 0.001), and uptake of preventative health measures (p < 0.001), which also varied geographically.

Effective urban forestry management is essential for enhancing ES, but challenging to develop in densely populated cities where tradeoffs between high ES provision and issues of periodic disaster-caused risks or maintenance costs must be balanced. With the aim of providing practical guidelines to promote green cities, this study developed an AI-based analytical approach to systematically evaluate tree conditions and detect management problems. By using a self-organizing map technique with a big dataset of Taipei street trees, we integrated the ES values estimated by i-Tree Eco to tree attributes of DBH, height, leaf area, and leaf area index (LAI) to comprehensively assess their complex relationship and interlinkage. We found that DBH and leaf area are good indicators for the provision of ES, allowing us to quantify the potential loss and tradeoffs by cross-checking with tree height and the correspondent ES values. In contrast, LAI is less effective in estimating ES than DBH and leaf area, but is useful as a supplementary one. We developed a detailed lookup table by compiling the tree datasets to assist the practitioners with a rapid assessment of tree conditions and associated loss of ES values. This analytical approach provides accessible, science-based information to appraise the right species, criteria, and place for landscape design. It gives explicit references and guidelines to help detect problems and guide directions for improving the ES and the sustainability of urban forests.

The World Health Organization (WHO) Global Strategy on Oral Health calls for prioritizing environmentally sustainable and less invasive oral health care, and planetary health. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to power the next generation of oral health services and care, however its relationship with the broader UN and WHO concepts of sustainability remains poorly defined and articulated. We review the double-edged relationships between AI and oral health, to suggest actions that promote a sustainable deployment of AI for oral health. Data: Concepts regarding AI, sustainability and sustainable development were identified and defined. A review of several double-edged relationship between AI and SDGs were exposed for the field of Oral Health. Sources: Medline and international declarations of the WHO, the UN and the World Dental Federation (FDI) were screened. Study selection: One the one hand, AI may reduce transportation, optimize care delivery (SDG 3 “Good Health and Well-Being”, SDG 13 “Climate Action”), and increase accessibility of services and reduce inequality (SDG 10 “Reduced Inequalities”, SDG 4 “Quality Education”). On the other hand, the deployment, implementation and maintenance of AI require significant resources (SDG 12 “Responsible Consumption and Production”), and costs for AI may aggravate inequalities. Also, AI may be biased, reinforcing inequalities (SDG 10) and discrimination (SDG 5), and may violate principles of security, privacy and confidentiality of personal information (SDG 16). Conclusions: Systematic assessment of the positive impact and adverse effects of AI on sustainable oral health may help to foster the former and curb the latter based on evidence. Clinical significance: If sustainability imperatives are actively taken into consideration, the community of oral health professionals should then employ AI for improving effectiveness, efficiency, and safety of oral healthcare; strengthen oral health surveillance; foster education and accessibility of care; ensure fairness, transparency and governance of AI for oral health; develop legislation and infrastructure to expand the use of digital health technologies including AI. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd','study object',0,'oral health','means','SDGs',NULL,NULL,NULL,'qualitative',NULL,NULL,'France',0),('2-s2.0-85141451707','Algorithms; Artificial Intelligence; Fuzzy Logic; Groundwater; Heuristics; Reproducibility of Results; Saudi Arabia; Saudi Arabia; Aquifers; Decision making; Errors; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Groundwater resources; Heuristic algorithms; Hydrogeology; Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; Mapping; Mean square error; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); calcium ion; chloride ion; ground water; magnesium ion; sodium ion; water; Adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference; Coastal aquifers; Groundwater salinizations; Mean absolute error; Neuro-fuzzy inference systems; Particle swarm; Salinity; Saudi Arabia; Swarm optimization; Water sustainability; ArcGIS; artificial intelligence; coastal aquifer; fuzzy mathematics; genetic algorithm; groundwater; heuristics; human activity; ion chromatography; mass spectrometry; salinization; spatial distribution; water management; accuracy; adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system; aquifer; Article; artificial intelligence; biogeography based optimization; calibration; chemical parameters; data processing; feature selection; genetic algorithm; geographic information system; geographic mapping; human impact (environment); inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; information processing; ion chromatography; machine learning; mean absolute error; mean absolute percentage error; metaheuristics; particle swarm optimization; root mean squared error; salinity; salinization; Saudi Arabia; seashore; simulation; socioeconomics; software; spatial analysis; statistical error; water supply; algorithm; fuzzy logic; heuristics; reproducibility; Saudi Arabia; Genetic algorithms','study object',0,'Mapping of groundwater salinization and modelling','means','long-term sustainable goals on the national and international levels by 2030 (Saudi Arabia Vision 2030, 2017)','regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','Saudi Arabia',NULL,'Saudi Arabia',0),('2-s2.0-85141596444','The rapid growth of the world population has increased the food demand as well as the need for assurance of food quality, safety, and sustainability.

However, smart grids require that energy managers become more concerned about the reliability and security of power systems. Therefore, energy planners use various methods and technologies to support the sustainable expansion of power systems, such as electricity demand forecasting models, stochastic optimization, robust optimization, and simulation. Electricity forecasting plays a vital role in supporting the reliable transitioning of power systems. This paper deals with short-term load forecasting (STLF), which has become an active area of research over the last few years, with a handful of studies. STLF deals with predicting demand one hour to 24 h in advance. We extensively experimented with several methodologies from machine learning and a complex case study in Panama.

However, commercially practiced pathways to hydrogen production todays, are associated with a considerable amount of carbon emissions. The Paris Climate Change Agreement has set out plans for an international commitment to reduce carbon emissions within the forthcoming decades. A sustainable hydrogen future would only be achievable if hydrogen production is “designed” to capture such emissions. Today, nearly 98% of global hydrogen production relies on the utilisation of fossil fuels. Among these, steam methane reforming (SMR) boasts the biggest share of nearly 50% of the global generation. SMR processes correspond to a significant amount of carbon emissions at various points throughout the process. Despite the dark side of the SMR processes, they are projected to play a major role in hydrogen production by the first half of this century. This that a sustainable, yet clean short/medium-term hydrogen production is only possible by devising a plan to efficiently capture this co-produced carbon as stated in the latest International Energy Agency (IEA) reports.

Dementia is not a mere individual health issue, since its interference with the ability to carry out daily activities entails a series of collateral problems, comprising exclusion of patients from civil rights and welfare, unpaid caregiving work, mostly performed by women, and an additional burden on the public healthcare systems. Thus, gender and wealth inequalities (both among individuals and among countries) tend to amplify the social impact of such a disease. Since at present there is no cure for dementia but only drug treatments to slow down its progress and mitigate the symptoms, it is essential to work on prevention and early diagnosis, identifying the risk factors that increase the probability of its onset. The complex and multifactorial etiology of dementia, resulting from an interplay between genetics and environmental factors, can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that follows the “One Health” guidelines of the World Health Organization. Methods: In this work, we apply methods of Artificial Intelligence and complex systems physics to investigate the possibility to predict dementia prevalence throughout world countries from a set of variables concerning individual health, food consumption, substance use and abuse, healthcare system efficiency. The analysis uses publicly available indicator values at a country level, referred to a time window of 26 years. Results: Employing methods based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and complex networks, we identify a group of lifestyle factors, mostly concerning nutrition, that contribute the most to dementia incidence prediction. Discussion: The proposed approach provides a methodological basis to develop quantitative tools for action patterns against such a disease, which involves issues deeply related with sustainable, such as good health and resposible food consumption.

The validation results demonstrate that the EFS-SVMIGWO model has consistently better accuracy and stable values than the benchmark methods (Including autoregressive integrated moving average, random forest, neural network and SVM models based on filtered selection methods). Moreover, IGWO is compared to differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and gray wolf optimizer (GWO), and the results show that IGWO has better convergence speed and solution quality in feature and model parameter parallel optimization tasks. Overall research and analysis indicate that the EFS-SVMIGWO model can exhibit convincing performance in monthly streamflow forecasting. Thus, it is of great importance to carefully choose the input variables and parameters to develop more effective models for forecasting monthly streamflow time series. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.','study object',0,'An embedded prediction model (EFSSVMIGWO) with improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO) and support vector machine (SVM) is proposed for streamflow prediction','means',NULL,'regional','snapshot','future','quantitative','China','The dataset used in the study is related to the monthly runoff records from January 1961 to December 2018 in the Kizil Reservoir','China',0),('2-s2.0-85144829455','The United Nations emphasized a significant agenda on reducing hunger and protein malnutrition as well as micronutrient (vitamins and minerals) malnutrition, which is estimated to affect the health of up to two billion people. The UN also recognized this need through Sustainable Development Goals (SDG 2 and SDG 12) to end hunger and foster sustainable agriculture by enhancing the production and consumption of fruits and vegetables. Previous studies only stressed the various issues in horticulture with regard to industries, but they did not emphasize the centrality of Industry 4.0 technologies for confronting the diverse issues in horticulture, from production to marketing in the context of sustainability. The current study addresses the significance and application of Industry 4.0 technologies such as the Internet of Things, cloud computing, artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data for horticulture in enhancing traditional practices for disease detection, irrigation management, fertilizer management, maturity identification, marketing, and supply chain, soil fertility, and weather patterns at pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest. On the basis of analysis, the article identifies challenges and suggests a few vital recommendations for future work.

Recently, in the field of physical ergonomics, several studies have also shown potential for improvement in experimental methods of ergonomic analysis, through the combined use of artificial intelligence, and wearable sensors. In this regard, this review intends to provide a first account of the investigations carried out using these combined methods, considering the period up to 2021. The method that combines the information obtained on the worker through physical sensors (IMU, accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) or biopotential sensors (EMG, EEG, EKG/ECG), with the analysis through artificial intelligence systems (machine learning or deep learning), offers interesting perspectives from both diagnostic, prognostic, and preventive points of view. In particular, the signals, obtained from wearable sensors for the recognition and categorization of the postural and biomechanical load of the worker, can be processed to formulate interesting algorithms for applications in the preventive field (especially with respect to musculoskeletal disorders), and with high statistical power. For Ergonomics, but also for Occupational Medicine, these applications improve the knowledge of the limits of the human organism, helping in the definition of sustainability thresholds, and in the ergonomic design of environments, tools, and work organization. The growth prospects for this research area are the refinement of the procedures for the detection and processing of signals; the expansion of the study to assisted working methods (assistive robots, exoskeletons), and to categories of workers suffering from pathologies or disabilities; as well as the development of risk assessment systems that exceed those currently used in ergonomics in precision and agility. © 2022 by the authors.','study object',0,'physical ergonomics','means',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'qualitative',NULL,NULL,'Italy',0),('2-s2.0-85144908873','As greenhouses are being widely adopted worldwide, it is important to improve the energy efficiency of the control systems while accurately regulating their indoor climate to realize sustainable agricultural practices for food production. In this work, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI)-based control framework that combines deep reinforcement learning techniques to generate insights into greenhouse operation combined with robust optimization to produce energy-efficient controls by hedging against associated uncertainties. The proposed control strategy is capable of learning from historical greenhouse climate trajectories while adapting to current climatic conditions and disturbances like time-varying crop growth and outdoor weather.

Indeed, twenty-first century education is being transformed into a global network (Dede & Richards, 2020), with new constellations already emerging (Phipps, 2019). From the outset, we analyse the omnipresence of the ‘western’ European tradition across the education systems globally (Bhambra et al., 2018; de Sousa Santos, 2014; Smith, 2012; Mignolo, 2011; Fanon, 2001; wa Thiong’o, 1986; 1969), and its incongruity with the knowledge and values needed for sustainable coexistence in the cyber-physical (hybrid) reality of natural life and AI. To do so, we refer to the work of Henrich et al. (2010, p 29) appearing in Nature, where the authors coined the acronymic pun, ‘WEIRD’, to highlight the education system’s ‘western, educated, industrialised, rich and democratic’ origins and ties. We not only use it but also propose to extend it by adding an additional letter, ‘O’, to ‘WEIRDO’ to underline the systems’ growing obsolescent content and values. We propose to reach beyond this WEIRD-ness, shifting the debate from ‘western’ eurocentrism and decolonisation into wider post-discriminatory and ethically committed approaches and practices, such as SEEDS: smart educational ecosystems of dependence and support. Underlining a gradual emergence of de-centralised and proactive initiatives, SEEDS focus on the ‘motion out of the notion of inclusivity into the concept of embracing’ (Tordzro, 2019a; 2019b; Tordzro, 2018; 2016; Kumordzi et al., 2016), constituting a set of signposts aimed at reconfiguration of the current epistemological, methodological and axiological disbalances into ones directed at harmonious co-existence and loving kindness. SEEDS is consonant with the recent reports of the European Commission (2022, online), emphasising the ‘triple imperative to protect, prepare and transform’, and UNESCO (2021) urging for a new social contract for education in the face of current dangers to humanity and planet Earth. Examples of such educational outlooks already exist, including Ubuntu (Caraccioli & Mungai, 2009), Adinkra (Tordzro, 2019a; 2019b), Afa (Kumordzi et al., 2016), Moana (Hendry & Fitznor, 2012), Hawaiian and Pacific (Herman, 2014), and the First Nations of the American (Pacari, 1996; Deloria, 1970) and Australian continents, each going beyond the WEIRD education system in the age of AI. © 2022, University of Malta.

The present study aims to develop a prediction model to forecast an installed PV system’s annual power generation yield and performance ratio (PR) using three environmental input parameters: solar irradiance, wind speed, and ambient air temperature. Three data-based artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, namely, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), response surface methodology (RSM), and artificial neural network (ANN), were employed. The models were developed using three years of data from an operational 2MWp Solar PV Project at Kuzhalmannam, Kerala state, India.

The results demonstrate that ANFIS was the most precise performance ratio prediction model, with an R2 value of 0.9830 and an RMSE of 0.6.

According to the statistics, 53% of respondents in the BlackRock survey are concerned about the availability of low ESG data, which is critical for determining the organization’s sustainability level. This obstacle can be overcome by implementing Industry 4.0 technologies, which enable real-time data, data authentication, prediction, transparency, authentication, and structured data. Based on the review of previous studies, it was determined that only a few studies discussed the implementation of Industry 4.0 technologies for ESG data and evaluation. The objective of the study is to discuss the significance of ESG data and report, which is used for the evaluation of the sustainability of an organization. In this regard, the assimilation of Industry 4.0 technologies (Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain, and big data for obtaining ESG data by an organization is detailed presented to study the progress of advancement of these technologies for ESG.

Though I4.0 related AI and ICT innovation has no direct effect in the short-run, its effects are determined through increased energy consumption towards emissions. The strong positive effects of energy consumption and positive effects of economic growth, ICT exports and R&D are observed both in the short and long-run. In addition to positive impacts of I4.0 on environment, the findings favor insufficiency of policies focusing on lowering emissions in I4.0 context.Policy recommendations include strong commitment to energy efficiency and renewable energies and trade policies with environmental concerns. © 2022','study object',1,'Model building to investigate relationship of industry 4.0 incl.

This study addresses this research gap through descriptive, hierarchical cluster and non-parametric analyses (Kruskal-Wallis tests and Spearman rank correlations) of the use of DTs for circular economy and sustainability management based on data collected in a structured telephone survey with 132 sustainability managers and CEOs of Austrian manufacturing companies. The paper shows for the first time the degree and stage of implementation of four key enabling DTs for a sustainable circular economy and 31 specific applications of those DTs across eight different industries. Of the four DTs, Internet of Things (IoT) technology is most widely implemented, followed by big data analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technology. However, their use in sustainability management is still very limited and is currently mainly in pilot phases. Of the 31 applications surveyed, IoT technology is most frequently used for collecting data from production processes, AI for predictive maintenance, big data analytics for demand forecasting, and blockchain technology for tracking product origins. Statistically significant differences were found in the degree of digitalization, in general, and for sustainability management between industries and company sizes. A strong positive correlation between the implementation of digital technologies in general and their use in a sustainability management context indicates synergies and spillover effects. The findings may help to tailor context-specific and purpose-driven strategies that selectively leverage the benefits of different DTs and supporting sustainability management effectively.

High-resolution measures of pollutants’ concentrations can support the identification of urban areas with poor air quality and raise citizens’ awareness while encouraging more sustainable behaviors. Recent advances in Internet of Things (IoT) technology have led to extensive use of low-cost air quality sensors for hyper-local air quality monitoring. As a result, public administrations and citizens increasingly rely on information obtained from sensors to make decisions in their daily lives and mitigate pollution effects. Unfortunately, in most sensing applications, sensors are known to be error-prone. Thanks to Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies, it is possible to devise computationally efficient methods that can automatically pinpoint anomalies in those data streams in real time. In order to enhance the reliability of air quality sensing applications, we believe that it is highly important to set up a data-cleaning process. In this work, we propose AIrSense, a novel AI-based framework for obtaining reliable pollutant concentrations from raw data collected by a network of low-cost sensors. It enacts an anomaly detection and repairing procedure on raw measurements before applying the calibration model, which converts raw measurements to concentration measurements of gasses. There are very few studies of anomaly detection in raw air quality sensor data (millivolts). Our approach is the first that proposes to detect and repair anomalies in raw data before they are calibrated by considering the temporal sequence of the measurements and the correlations between different sensor features. If at least some previous measurements are available and not anomalous, it trains a model and uses the prediction to repair the observations; otherwise, it exploits the previous observation. Firstly, a majority voting system based on three different algorithms detects anomalies in raw data. Then, anomalies are repaired to avoid missing values in the measurement time series. In the end, the calibration model provides the pollutant concentrations. Experiments conducted on a real dataset of 12,000 observations produced by 12 low-cost sensors demonstrated the importance of the data-cleaning process in improving calibration algorithms’ performances. © 2023 by the authors.','study object',0,'air quality sensing','means',NULL,'local','longitudinal','present','quantitative','Italy','hard sensors','Italy',0),('2-s2.0-85146584488','The need for innovation in the healthcare sector is essential to meet the demand of a rapidly growing population and the advent of progressive chronic ailments.

Among various deep learning architectures, a diversity of YOLO (You Only Look Once) detectors is well-suited for real-time application and has enjoyed great popularity for generic object detection. This study presents a new dataset (CottoWeedDet12) of weeds important to cotton production in the southern United States (U.S.); it consists of 5648 images of 12 weed classes with a total of 9370 bounding box annotations, collected under natural light conditions and at varied weed growth stages in cotton fields. A novel, comprehensive benchmark of 25 state-of-the-art YOLO object detectors of seven versions including YOLOv3, YOLOv4, Scaled-YOLOv4, YOLOR and YOLOv5, YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, has been established for weed detection on the dataset. Evaluated through the Monte-Caro cross validation with 5 replications, the detection accuracy in terms of mAP@0.5 ranged from 88.14 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 95.22 % by YOLOv4, and the accuracy in terms of mAP@[0.5:0.95] ranged from 68.18 % by YOLOv3-tiny to 89.72 % by Scaled-YOLOv4. All the YOLO models especially YOLOv5n and YOLOv5s have shown great potential for real-time weed detection, and data augmentation could increase weed detection accuracy. Both the weed detection dataset and software program codes for model benchmarking in this study are publicly available, which will be to be valuable resources for promoting future research on big data and AI-empowered weed detection and control for cotton and potentially other crops. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.','method',0,'YOLO weeds in cotton production','means','effective week management','regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','United States of America','weeds important to cotton','United States of America',0),('2-s2.0-85147006045','Grassland detection is essential for sustainable development, particularly in ecological and animal husbandry. Hyperspectral can retrieve the functional characteristics of vegetation species, nevertheless, the efficiency of grassland communities with rich species at different periods needs to be improved. In this study, the multi-temporal grass hyperspectral classification via full pixel decomposition spectral manifold projection and boosting active learning (FPD-SMP-BAL) model is proposed to relieve the above issue. Considering the plentiful spectral information of hyperspectral, we proposed a novel preprocessing method of spectral manifold projection based on full pixel decomposition (FPD-SMP), which reveals the internal nonlinear structure of global hyperspectral and alleviate the data redundancy. Furthermore, we innovatively designed the boosting active learning (BAL) classification model with an effective optimization strategy, which can decrease the cost of sample labeling by the minimal loss value. An on-site hyperspectral acquisition platform was assembled, and a dataset of 4,200 samples was established from the perspective of vegetation species composition and multi-stages to verify the validity of the model. Experimental results show that the proposed FPD-SMP-BAL framework reaches an overall accuracy of 94.94%, which is superior to some state-of-the-art methods in the classification of multi-temporal grass hyperspectral images, and also provides a reference for related research of grassland dynamic monitoring. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.','method',0,'grassland classification with hyperspectral data','means','sustainable use of ressources','regional','snapshot','present','quantitative','China','field data hyperspectral images','China',0),('2-s2.0-85147249437','Smart farming with artificial intelligence provides an efficient solution to today\'s agricultural sustainability challenges. Machine learning, Deep learning, and time series analysis are essential in smart farming. Crop selection, crop yield prediction, soil compatibility classification, water management, and many other processes are involved in agriculture. Machine learning algorithms are used for crop selection and management, Deep learning techniques are used for crop selection and forecasting crop production, and time series analysis is used for demand forecasting of crops, commodity price prediction, and crop yield production forecasting. Crops are chosen using machine learning algorithms and deep learning algorithms based on soil, soil compatibility classification, and other factors. In the agriculture industry, this article offers a thorough review of machine learning and deep learning techniques. Crop data sets can be used to classify soil fertility, crop selection, and many other aspects using machine learning algorithms. Deep learning algorithms can be applied to farming data to do time series analysis and crop selection. Because there is more need for food due to the growing population, crop production forecasting is one of the crucial tasks. Therefore, future crop production must be predicted in order to overcome food insufficiency. In this article, several time series algorithms were reviewed.

Generally, we can find a variety of applications proposed for this purpose that include fruit counting. These applications are based on Artificial Intelligence, especially Deep Learning (DL) and Machine Learning (ML) approaches. These approaches give reliable counting accuracy, but the problem is the use of a large database to achieve the desired accuracy. That makes these approaches limited. For this reason, in this work, we propose a low-complexity algorithm that aims to count green and red apples based on our real dataset collected in the Moroccan region, Fes-Meknes. This algorithm allowed us to further increase sustainability in agricultural fields based on yield prediction. The proposed approach was based on HSV conversion and the Hough transform for fruit counting. The algorithm was divided into three blocks based on image acquisition and filtering for the first block. The second block is the conversion to HSV and the detection of fruits. Finally, the counting operation for the third block. Subsequently, we proposed an implementation based on the low-cost Raspberry system and a desktop. The results show that we can reach 15 fps in the case of the Raspberry architecture and 40 fps based on the desktop.

Limited understanding of the factors that influence its implementation can perpetuate this. Objective: In this qualitative systematic review, we aimed to identify key stakeholders, consolidate their perspectives on clinical AI implementation, and characterize the evidence gaps that future qualitative research should target. Methods: Ovid-MEDLINE, EBSCO-CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, Science Citation Index-Web of Science, and Scopus were searched for primary qualitative studies on individuals’ perspectives on any application of clinical AI worldwide (January 2014-April 2021). The definition of clinical AI includes both rule-based and machine learning–enabled or non–rule-based decision support tools. The language of the reports was not an exclusion criterion. Two independent reviewers performed title, abstract, and full-text screening with a third arbiter of disagreement. Two reviewers assigned the Joanna Briggs Institute 10-point checklist for qualitative research scores for each study. A single reviewer extracted free-text data relevant to clinical AI implementation, noting the stakeholders contributing to each excerpt. The best-fit framework synthesis used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework. To validate the data and improve accessibility, coauthors representing each emergent stakeholder group codeveloped summaries of the factors most relevant to their respective groups. Results: The initial search yielded 4437 deduplicated articles, with 111 (2.5%) eligible for inclusion (median Joanna Briggs Institute 10-point checklist for qualitative research score, 8/10). Five distinct stakeholder groups emerged from the data: health care professionals (HCPs), patients, carers and other members of the public, developers, health care managers and leaders, and regulators or policy makers, contributing 1204 (70%), 196 (11.4%), 133 (7.7%), 129 (7.5%), and 59 (3.4%) of 1721 eligible excerpts, respectively. All stakeholder groups independently identified a breadth of implementation factors, with each producing data that were mapped between 17 and 24 of the 27 adapted Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability subdomains. Most of the factors that stakeholders found influential in the implementation of rule-based clinical AI also applied to non–rule-based clinical AI, with the exception of intellectual property, regulation, and sociocultural attitudes. Conclusions: Clinical AI implementation is influenced by many interdependent factors, which are in turn influenced by at least 5 distinct stakeholder groups. This implies that effective research and practice of clinical AI implementation should consider multiple stakeholder perspectives. The current underrepresentation of perspectives from stakeholders other than HCPs in the literature may limit the anticipation and management of the factors that influence successful clinical AI implementation. Future research should not only widen the representation of tools and contexts in qualitative research but also specifically investigate the perspectives of all stakeholder HCPs and emerging aspects of non–rule-based clinical AI implementation. ©Henry David Jeffry Hogg, Mohaimen Al-Zubaidy, Technology Enhanced Macular Services Study Reference Group, James Talks, Alastair K Denniston, Christopher J Kelly, Johann Malawana, Chrysanthi Papoutsi, Marion Dawn Teare, Pearse A Keane, Fiona R Beyer, Gregory Maniatopoulos.','study object',0,'stakeholders perspective of clinical AI','means','buzzword',NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'United Kingdom',1),('2-s2.0-85148346084','The global human population is constantly increasing whereas the agricultural land resources are declining for reasons of urban settlements and industrial growth.

Recently, the exploration of alternative food sources has been supported by numerous governmental and research organizations, as well as by small and large commercial ventures. Microalgae are gaining momentum as an effective source of alternative laboratory-based nutritional proteins as they are easy to grow under variable environmental conditions, with the added advantage of absorbing carbon dioxide. Despite their attractiveness, the utilization of microalgae faces several practical limitations. Here, we discuss both the potential and challenges of microalgae in food sustainability and their possible long-term contribution to the circular economy of converting food waste into feed via modern methods. We also argue that systems biology and artificial intelligence can play a role in overcoming some of the challenges and limitations; through data-guided metabolic flux optimization, and by systematically increasing the growth of the microalgae strains without negative outcomes, such as toxicity.

With these advancements in AI techniques, we can reduce our environmental impact, while simultaneously enhancing the quality of our services. Widespread use of these devices for innovative IoT applications, however, generates massive amounts of data, which can significantly strain processing power.

The blockchain has been employed to achieve the secure IoMT. Unlike long short-term memory units, they do not have a cell state of their own.

Current digital approaches do not meet these challenges due to a lack of efficient and lack of real-time non-invasive precision measurement technologies that can detect and monitor animal diseases and identify resilience in animals. In this opinion review paper, I offer a critical view of the potential of wearable sensor technologies as a unique and necessary contribution to the global market for farm animal health monitoring.

This paper aims to assess and analyse attitudes and preferences of young Saudi females towards a number of policies and plans that are designed to meeting sustainable targets, using fuzzy logic analysis. This is a very important aim, especially since Vision 2030 in Saudi Arabia puts a major emphasis on sustainability, setting many resources to tackle environmental problems and achieving better social standards. The Methodology includes designing and collecting data from 199 participants using a questionnaire that includes 23 questions. Data were obtained from students at Princess Nourah bint Abdulrahman University (PNU). The analysis includes utilising artificial intelligence (AI) techniques. Fuzzy logic analysis has been widely used in many fields, but has not seen many applications on food waste analysis and attitudes. Fuzzy logic analysis has the advantage of producing efficient results from smaller sample sizes and, in particular, with qualitative characteristics of the used indicators. The participants expressed positive preferences and attitudes towards the programs and policies that are designed to achieve sustainability and manage food waste. The results show that over 25% of them prefer the option of “storage for reuse” of food waste, over 35% prefer the option of distribute it to needed families and over 30% opted to the option of recycling to fertilisers. The study also reveals a very good level of awareness and appreciation of food waste and plans associated with it.

Microalgae-based wastewater treatment has resulted in a paradigm shift in our approach toward nutrient removal and simultaneous resource recovery from wastewater. Wastewater treatment and the generation of biofuels and bioproducts from microalgae can be coupled to promote the circular economy synergistically. A microalgal biorefinery transforms microalgal biomass into biofuels, bioactive chemicals, and biomaterials. The large-scale cultivation of microalgae is essential for the commercialization and industrialization of microalgae biorefinery. However, the inherent complexity of microalgal cultivation parameters regarding physiological and illumination parameters renders it challenging to facilitate a smooth and cost-effective operation. Artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning algorithms (MLA) offer innovative strategies for assessing, predicting, and regulating uncertainties in algal wastewater treatment and biorefinery. The current study presents a critical review of the most promising AI/MLAs that demonstrate a potential to be applied in microalgal technologies. The most commonly used MLAs include artificial neural networks, support vector machine, genetic algorithms, decision tree, and random forest algorithms. Recent developments in AI have made it possible to combine cutting-edge techniques from AI research fields with microalgae for accurate analysis of large datasets. MLAs have been extensively studied for their potential in microalgae detection and classification. However, the ML application in microalgal industries, such as optimizing microalgae cultivation for increased biomass productivity, is still in its infancy.

For instance, concerns about market and policy responses that could lead to new lock-ins, such as investing in liquefied natural gas infrastructure and using all available fossil fuels to compensate for Russian gas supply cuts, may hinder decarbonization efforts. Here we review energy-saving solutions with a focus on the actual energy crisis, green alternatives to fossil fuel heating, energy saving in buildings and transportation, artificial intelligence for sustainable energy, and implications for the environment and society. Green alternatives include biomass boilers and stoves, hybrid heat pumps, geothermal heating, solar thermal systems, solar photovoltaics systems into electric boilers, compressed natural gas and hydrogen. We also detail case studies in Germany which is planning a 100% renewable energy switch by 2050 and developing the storage of compressed air in China, with emphasis on technical and economic aspects. The global energy consumption in 2020 was 30.01% for the industry, 26.18% for transport, and 22.08% for residential sectors. 10–40% of energy consumption can be reduced using renewable energy sources, passive design strategies, smart grid analytics, energy-efficient building systems, and intelligent energy monitoring. Electric vehicles offer the highest cost-per-kilometer reduction of 75% and the lowest energy loss of 33%, yet battery-related issues, cost, and weight are challenging. 5–30% of energy can be saved using automated and networked vehicles. Artificial intelligence shows a huge potential in energy saving by improving weather forecasting and machine maintenance and enabling connectivity across homes, workplaces, and transportation. For instance, 18.97–42.60% of energy consumption can be reduced in buildings through deep neural networking. In the electricity sector, artificial intelligence can automate power generation, distribution, and transmission operations, balance the grid without human intervention, enable lightning-speed trading and arbitrage decisions at scale, and eliminate the need for manual adjustments by end-users. © 2023, The Author(s).','study object',0,'strategies to save energy','means',NULL,NULL,'snapshot','present','qualitative',NULL,'literature','Japan',0),('2-s2.0-85150642974','Oil and gas construction projects are critical for meeting global demand for fossil fuels, but they also present unique risks and challenges that require innovative construction approaches.

Artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare decision-making based on clinical knowledge and data are gaining traction as a way to enhance healthcare delivery by making smart diagnosis and treatment decisions. However, there are indeed a number of factors that require comprehensive inspection to ensure a sustainable AI-based decision making system in the healthcare domain. Therefore, this research explores 15 key sustainability indicators for incorporating AI applications in healthcare decision-making and performs a systematic assessment to prioritize the indicators according to the viewpoints of 35 relevant experts in context of the Bangladeshi health industry. Professional judgements on the level of significance for each indicators have been converted into quantitative data and plotted graphically in terms of their relative importance and divergence of opinions. Furthermore, the indicators have been categorized into three groups using two types of clustering techniques: K-means and agglomerative clustering approaches. According to the findings of the investigation, among the three clusters, one of them consisting of six indicators have considerably greater relative importance values with lesser opinion divergence, and hence are extremely crucial factors for ensuring sustainability.

To design an SHM system that delivers optimal monitoring outcomes, engineers must make decisions on numerous system specifications, including the sensor types, numbers, and placements, as well as data transfer, storage, and data analysis techniques. Optimization algorithms are employed to optimize the system settings, such as the sensor configuration, that significantly impact the quality and information density of the captured data and, hence, the system performance. Optimal sensor placement (OSP) is defined as the placement of sensors that results in the least amount of monitoring cost while meeting predefined performance requirements. An optimization algorithm generally finds the “best available” values of an objective function, given a specific input (or domain). Various optimization algorithms, from random search to heuristic algorithms, have been developed by researchers for different SHM purposes, including OSP. This paper comprehensively reviews the most recent optimization algorithms for SHM and OSP. The article focuses on the following: (I) the definition of SHM and all its components, including sensor systems and damage detection methods, (II) the problem formulation of OSP and all current methods, (III) the introduction of optimization algorithms and their types, and (IV) how various existing optimization methodologies can be applied to SHM systems and OSP methods. Our comprehensive comparative review revealed that applying optimization algorithms in SHM systems, including their use for OSP, to derive an optimal solution, has become increasingly common and has resulted in the development of sophisticated methods tailored to SHM.

Therefore, their conservation and restoration are of fundamental importance for sustainable development. This study used a deep learning model for groundwater level prediction to evaluate a wetland restoration project implemented in the Kushiro Wetland in Japan. The Kushiro Wetland had been degraded due to river improvement work. However, in 2010, a wetland restoration project was carried out to restore the meandering river channel, and a decade has passed since its completion. In this study, the wetland restoration project was evaluated by comparing the response of the groundwater level using a model that reproduced physical conditions with different characteristics before and after the restoration. At first, a deep learning model was created to predict groundwater levels pre- and post-restoration of a meandering river channel using observation data. Long short-term memory (LSTM) was used as the deep learning model. The most important aspect of this study was that LSTM was trained for each of the pre- and post-restoration periods when the hydrological and geological characteristics changed due to the river channel’s restoration. The trained LSTM model achieved high performance with a prediction error of the groundwater levels within 0.162 m at all observation points. Next, the LSTM models trained with the observation data of the post-restoration period were applied to evaluate the effectiveness of the meandering channel restoration. The results indicated that the meandering channel restoration improved hydrological processes in groundwater levels, i.e., their rainfall response and average groundwater water levels. Furthermore, the variable importance analysis of the explanatory variables in the LSTM model showed that river discharge and precipitation significantly contributed to groundwater level recovery in the Kushiro Wetland. These results indicated that the LSTM model could learn the differences in hydrological and geological characteristics’ changes due to channel restoration to groundwater levels. Furthermore, LSTM is a data-driven deep learning model, and by learning hydrological and geological conditions to identify factors that may affect groundwater levels, LSTM has the potential to become a powerful analysis method that can be used for environmental management and conservation issues. © 2023 by the authors.','method',0,'river restoration and effect on groundwater level','means','conservation and restoration','regional','longitudinal','present','quantitative','Japan','temperature, sunshine hours, Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Figurep5r.eTcimpietasteiroiens, osfngorwounddewptahte,ralenvdelraivnderpdreicsicphitartgioen','Japan',0),('2-s2.0-85151953923','Purpose: With an industry 5.0 revolution taking place in the hospitality industry, a shift from manual to cognitive labor is anticipated, characterized by greater sustainability, resilience and a human-centric approach.

Accordingly, incorporating Recycled Concrete Aggregate (RCA) as a partial replacement for Natural Aggregates (NAs) in WMA design has been gaining notoriety in the literature as a viable alternative to increase sustainability. However, the eco-friendly manufacturing of WMA with RCA contents (WMA-RCA) is not easy to obtain satisfactorily because the RCA causes alterations in the mix design. Thus, this research proposes three (3) methods to determine the optimal design conditions (coarse RCA content) that minimize the environmental burdens caused by WMA-RCA production.

This is tested in the Mijares watershed in eastern Spain. As a first step, we propose using integrated modeling technology to quickly assess areas of ecosystem goods and services supply and demand within the case study. To this end, we applied ARIES, an AI-driven online modeling platform widely used in the ES community. Then, we use this information to identify suitable SLM options documented in the WOCAT global database for providing the identified ES. Lastly, to adjust the results to the social-ecological context, we carry out consulting and participatory processes with key stakeholders to incorporate local knowledge of ES and capabilities to adopt SLM measures into the final proposal. As a result of this work, we can model various SLM scenarios, easing decision-making toward more integrated and sustainable land management in the watershed.

In arid and extremely arid regions such as Iran, the time and duration of irrigation is the key to achieving sustainable irrigation. Therefore, in this research, after constructing a garden in Iran, Karaj, Imam Khomeini Higher Education Center with an area of 0.05 ha, and installing equipment related to irrigation and fertilization, a fuzzy control system was designed to optimize water consumption and inputs, intelligent irrigation and fertilization system. The present study presents a practical solution based on artificial intelligence in which all stages of design and implementation are described. In this system, a microcontroller was first used to process and store data on soil moisture, ambient temperature and solar radiation. The fuzzy logic controller then takes these three inputs and based on the table of rules created for a specific product, produces the desired irrigation time and duration. Experimental results showed that, the developed system accurately compensates for the amount of water lost through evapotranspiration. It seems that the use of fuzzy control has a great impact on irrigation management and planning in the near future. © 2023, Int. Comm. of Agricultural and Biosystems Engineering.

To effectively address this issue, a convergence of agriculture and technology is crucial, incorporating precision agriculture, sustainable agriculture, bio-economy and advanced technologies such as machineries, Artificial intelligence-meachine learning and geospatial technology. Recent trends in food security worldwide have witnessed the adoption of technological advancements. However, it is important to consider biodiversity when implementing and adopting technological advancements. The integration of technology in agricultural practices aim to reduce chemical usage in farms, while increased production remains the main objective of smart farming and Precision Agriculture. By minimizing the use or implementing localized approaches for chemicals on farms, we can preserve soil-faunal diversity, which is at risk along with targets due to excessive applications of pesticides, herbicides, and insecticides. Geospatial technology plays a significant role by leveraging remotely sensed images acquired through satellites, aerial platforms, and GPS-tagged drones to enhance agricultural practices, improve crop growth and increase crop yields. Through geospatial technology, we can map and monitor soil and crop conditions, and effectively conserve, protect, and manage biodiversity on a global scale. The applications of remote sensing technology consider ecological and environmental parameters, soil factors, crop conditions, and plant-soil diversity to optimize yields and agricultural productivity.

It also causes approximately one third of all European Union and U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, represents a major health hazard for global populations, and poses significant economic costs (e.g., due to traffic congestion). However, rapid innovation in vehicle technology, mobile connectivity, computing hardware, and artificial intelligence-powered information systems heralds a deep socio-technical transformation of the sector. The emergence of connected, autonomous, shared, and electric vehicle technology has created a digital layer that resides on top of the traditional physical mobility system. The resulting layered modular architecture is similar to that seen in other cyber-physical systems. Yet, it also comes with several characteristics and challenges that are unique to the domain of mobility and require entirely new solution approaches. Although other management and domain-specific research disciplines have started to embrace the new opportunities for research resulting from this deep structural change, the information systems (IS) community\'s involvement in smart mobility research has been marginal. Yet, we argue that our field\'s uniquely multidisciplinary, data-driven, and socio-technical research lens puts it in a strong position to address many of the large-scale societal challenges encountered in the mobility sector. Therefore, we make the case for IS research to play an active role in delivering a smart sustainable mobility ecosystem that is beneficial to users, mobility providers and the environment. We contribute a research framework to direct IS research efforts while providing a shared understanding of the smart sustainable mobility domain. We also present seven IS research opportunities along the dimensions of this framework and propose concrete angles of attack which we hope will spur an impactful and structured research agenda in the area.

By leveraging Industry 5.0-enabling technologies, such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, blockchain, big data analytics, etc., we can cultivate students to be job-ready for the future of work by providing them with hands-on experience in advanced healthcare technologies. Ultimately, this new training and education paradigm in digital health can help bridge the gap between training and the world of work and prepare students to deliver a more efficient, effective, and sustainable healthcare system. Digital transformation, characterised by advanced digitalisation, blockchain, the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, machine learning technologies, and robotics, has played a key role in revolutionising various industries, especially the healthcare sector. The adoption of and transition (from traditional) to new technology will bring challenges, opportunities, and disruptions to existing healthcare systems. According to the European Union, we must pursue both digital and green transitions to achieve sustainable, human-centric, and resilient industries to achieve a world of prosperity for all. The study aims to present a novel approach to education and training in the digital health field that is inspired by the fifth industrial revolution paradigm. The paper highlights the role of training and education interventions that are required to support digital health in the future so that students can develop the capacity to recognise and exploit the potential of new technologies.

Traditional materials engineering education has often relied on a transmission teaching approach, in which students are expected to passively receive information from instructors. However, this approach has shown to be inadequate under the current circumstances, in which information is readily available and innovative tools such as artificial intelligence and virtual reality environments are becoming widespread (e.g., metaverse). Instead, we consider that a critical goal of education should be to develop aptitudes and abilities that enable students to generate solutions and products that address societal demands. In this work, we propose innovative strategies, such as product-based learning methods and GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) artificial intelligence text generation models, to modify the focus of a Materials in Chemical Engineering course from non-sustainable materials to sustainable ones, aiming to address the critical challenges of our society. This approach aims to achieve two objectives: first to enable students to actively engage with raw materials and solve real-world challenges, and second, to foster creativity and entrepreneurship skills by providing them with the necessary tools to conduct brainstorming sessions and develop procedures following scientific methods. The incorporation of circular bioeconomy concepts, such as renewable resources, waste reduction, and resource efficiency into the curriculum provides a framework for students to understand the environmental, social, and economic implications in Chemical Engineering.

Innovative agricultural advancements has undoubtedly supported the expansion of the capacity and efficiency of different agricultural activities. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization assessment, the world\'s population is expected to reach 8.5 billion by 2030, and 9.6 billion by 2050 which will result in an unprecedented demand for food and agriculture products. It is estimated that the food production should increase by 70 percent to meet such a demand. Given the limited farming space, lack of water, climate change, and constantly changing environmental conditions, new and innovative smart agriculture solutions must be developed. In general, there has been an increase in the agricultural production volume over the time to ensure the food security. Efforts are being made to increase the quality and quantity of agribusiness products by transforming them into smart and connected products through a smart agriculture industry. Smart and precision agriculture refers to the integration of technology, such as the Internet of things, sensors, robotics, artificial intelligence, smart supply chains, big data analytics, and blockchain, into the agriculture industry.

To enhance the synergistic relationship between pollination service and crop yield in agricultural landscapes, a better appreciation of the spatial dynamics of pollination service provisioning is needed. Spatially explicit modelling approaches have been used to investigate how different land cover types influence the distribution and abundance of wild bee pollinators in agricultural landscapes. However, an integrated dynamic and spatial modelling framework is needed to address the complexities of pollination supply mapping at the landscape scale. The Artificial Intelligence for Environment and Sustainability (ARIES) framework is a collaborative, spatially explicit and integrated tool for ES assessment. We applied a set of high-resolution process-based pollination models within ARIES to represent landscape capacity to supply pollination by wild bees at the local scale in the Canadian prairies. We also developed a systematic approach to perform a global sensitivity analysis by using a surrogate model (Gaussian Process Regression) and variance-based sensitivity analysis for the selected uncertain key parameters of the model. We modelled pollination dynamics through the mechanistic behavior of native bee guilds, including foraging distance, nesting ability, flight activity, the relative importance of bee guilds, and seasonal variation of floral resources. We focused on three guilds, bumblebees, sweat bees and mining bees, which differed by their nesting habits, floral preferences, and flight distances. We found that over 45% of pollination-dependent croplands in our study area lack wild pollination. The global sensitivity analysis revealed the significance of all key parameters, with seasonal activity across guilds identified as the key driving factors.

Sustainable agriculture is necessary to solve this food security challenge. Disruptive technologies, such as of artificial intelligence, especially, deep learning techniques can contribute to agricultural sustainability. For example, applying deep learning techniques for early disease classification allows us to take timely action, thereby helping to increase the yield without inflicting unnecessary environmental damage, such as excessive use of fertilisers or pesticides. Several studies have been conducted on agricultural sustainability using deep learning techniques and also semantic web technologies such as ontologies and knowledge graphs. However, the three major challenges remain: (i) the lack of explainability of deep learning-based systems (e.g. disease information), especially to non-experts like farmers; (ii) a lack of contextual information (e.g. soil or plant information) and domain-expert knowledge in deep learning-based systems; and (iii) the lack of pattern learning ability of systems based on the semantic web, despite their ability to incorporate domain knowledge. Therefore, this paper presents the work on disease classification, addressing the challenges as mentioned earlier by combining deep learning and semantic web technologies, namely ontologies and knowledge graphs. The findings are: (i) 0.905 (90.5%) prediction accuracy on large noisy dataset; (ii) ability to generate user-level explanations about disease and incorporate contextual and domain knowledge; (iii) the average prediction latency of 3.8514 s on 5268 samples; (iv) 95% of users finding the explanation of the proposed method useful; and (v) 85% of users being able to understand generated explanations easily—show that the proposed method is superior to the state-of-the-art in terms of performance and explainability and is also suitable for real-world scenarios. © 2023 The Author(s)','method',0,'Sustainable food systems','means',NULL,'local','longitudinal','future','quantitative','Uganda','Survey','Austria',0),('2-s2.0-85166156338','As the citizen science (CS) community flourishes, there is an opportunity to reflect on how practitioners can widen participation and work with participants as co-researchers to investigate and take action around global challenges.

Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many countries, including China, have promoted the introduction of digital health in their medical services. Developing the next generation of physicians with digital health knowledge and skills is a prerequisite for maximizing the potential of digital health. Objective: We aimed to understand the perception of digital health among Chinese medical students, the current implementation of digital health education in China, and the urgent need of medical students. Methods: Our cross-sectional survey was conducted online and anonymously among current medical students in China. We used descriptive statistical analysis to examine participant demographic characteristics and the demand for digital health education. Additional analysis was conducted by grouping responses by current participation in a digital health course. Results: A total of 2122 valid responses were received from 467 medical schools. Most medical students had positive expectations that digital health will change the future of medicine. Compared with wearable devices (85.53%), telemedicine (84.16%), and medical big data (86.38%), fewer respondents believed in the benefits of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) (63.81%). Most respondents said they urgently needed digital health knowledge and skills, and the teaching method of practical training and internship (78.02%) was more popular than the traditional lecture (10.54%). However, only 41.45% wanted to learn about the ethical and legal issues surrounding digital health. Conclusions: Our study shows that the current needs of Chinese medical students for digital health education remain unmet. A national initiative on digital health education, is necessary and attention should be paid to digital health equity and education globally, focusing on CDSS and artificial intelligence.

The massive increase in data gathering through social networks, traditional business systems, and Internet of Things (IoT)-based sensor devices raises real questions regarding the capacity of national statistical systems (NSS) for utilizing big data sources. Further, in this current era, big data is captured through sensor-based systems in public sector organizations. To gauge the capacity of public sector institutions in this regard, this work provides an indicator to monitor the processing capacity of the public sector organizations within the country (Pakistan). Some of the indicators related to measuring the capacity of the NSS were captured through a census-based survey. At the same time, convex logistic principal component analysis was used to develop scores and relative capacity indicators. The findings show that most organizations hesitate to disseminate data due to concerns about data privacy and that public sector organizations’ IT personnel are unable to deal with big data sources to generate official statistics. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques can be used to overcome these challenges, such as automating data processing, improving data privacy and security, and enhancing the capabilities of IT human resources.

A case analysis of water usage shows that, given the limited availability of water resources in the context of the carbon-water balance, regional collaboration and optimized allocation have the potential to enhance the utilization efficiency of water resources in the river basin. A suggested approach is to consider the river basin as a unified entity and coordinate the relationship between the upstream, midstream and downstream areas. Furthermore, establishing mechanisms for water resource transfer and trade among different industries can be instrumental in maximizing the benefits derived from water resources. Finally, we envisage a future of agriculture characterized by the integration of digital, robotic and biological farming techniques.

The rates of human papillomavirus vaccination and CaCx screening remain low. Digital health tools and interventions have the potential to improve different aspects of CaCx screening and control in Uganda. Objective: This study aimed to describe stakeholders’ perceptions of the telemedicine system we developed to improve CaCx screening in Uganda. Methods: We developed and implemented a smartphone-based telemedicine system for capturing and sharing cervical images and other clinical data, as well as an artificial intelligence model for automatic analysis of images. We conducted focus group discussions with health workers at the screening clinics (n=27) and women undergoing screening (n=15) to explore their perceptions of the system. The focus group discussions were supplemented with field observations and an evaluation survey of the health workers on system usability and the overall project. Results: In general, both patients and health workers had positive opinions about the system. Highlighted benefits included better cervical visualization, the ability to obtain a second opinion, improved communication between nurses and patients (to explain screening findings), improved clinical data management, performance monitoring and feedback, and modernization of screening service. However, there were also some negative perceptions. For example, some health workers felt the system is time-consuming, especially when it had just been introduced, while some patients were apprehensive about cervical image capture and sharing. Finally, commonplace challenges in digital health (eg, lack of interoperability and problems with sustainability) and challenges in cancer screening in general (eg, arduous referrals, inadequate monitoring and quality control) also resurfaced. Conclusions: This study demonstrates the feasibility and value of digital health tools in CaCx screening in Uganda, particularly with regard to improving patient experience and the quality of screening services. It also provides examples of potential limitations that must be addressed for successful implementation. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

This study used the established dropout risk prediction model to improve student learning effectiveness. The model was based on the academic portfolios of past students and built with statistical learning and deep learning methods. This study used this model to predict the dropout risk of 2205 freshmen enrolled in the fall semester of 2018 (graduated in June 2022) in the field of sustainable education. A total of 176 students with a dropout risk of more than 20% were considered high-risk students. After tracking and the appropriate guidance, the dropout risk of 91 students fell from > 20% to < 20%. To discuss the results from the perspective of gender and financial disadvantages, the improvement rate of the dropout risk for male students was 10.2% better than that of female students at 2.9%. The improvement rate in dropout risk for students with disadvantageous financial situations was as high as 12.0%, surpassing the 5.9% rate among general students. Overall, the dropout rate in the second year of the 2018 freshman cohort was lower than that of the 2016 and 2017 freshman cohorts.

Therefore, developing high-performance chemosensors with excellent stability, sensitivity, selectivity, stability, low power consumption, and cost-effectiveness can monitor the environment that is needed for ecological restoration. For a wide application and to support a sustainable society, such chemosensors are expected to perform in an AAA manner (i.e. acceptable, affordable, and applicable) and can be possible only by utilizing tailored and functionalized green nanostructures (NSs). In this direction, zinc oxide (ZnO), due to desired and controlled structural diversity, controllable pore size/geometry, large specific surface area, and host-guest interactions, hold great promise for fabricating various ZnO NSs-based sensors for the detection of metallic ions/molecules.

Under an action research methodology, we introduced this novel instrument in a course on Future Studies. Students were evaluated on their ability to explain to ChatGPT several discipline-specific methods and to make the AI implement these methods step by step. After six such activities, the outcomes evidenced that the students not only learned how to use the new AI tool and deepen their understanding of prospective methods, but also strengthened three soft or transversal competencies: communication, critical thinking, and logical and methodical reasoning. These results are promising in the framework of Skills for Industry 4.0 and Education for Sustainable Development; even more, they demonstrate how ChatGPT created an opportunity for the students to strengthen, and for the professor to assess, time-tested competencies. This is a call-to action for faculty and educational institutions to incorporate AI in their instructional design, not only to prepare our graduates for professional environments where they will collaborate with these technologies but also to enhance the quality and relevance of higher education in the digital age.

It is necessary to resolve the contradiction between increasing yields and preserving the environment. In this sense, modern technological solutions in agriculture should be applied, which will lead to an increase in productivity, i.e. creating a higher yield on the same or smaller areas. This can be achieved by optimizing the use of inputs in agriculture by introducing different solutions within precision agriculture. AI is one solution that needs to be developed and that leads to sustainable development. Adequate education, digital literacy and appropriate infrastructure are also required for its application.

Technological advancements like Tor, bitcoin, and cryptocurrencies allow criminals to carry out these activities anonymously, leading to increased use of the Darkweb. At the same time, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives, shaping our behavior, and influencing how we interact with each other and the world. This work carries out the bibliometric study on the research conducted on Darkweb over the last decade. The findings illustrate that most research on Darkweb can be clustered into four areas based on keyword co-occurrence analysis: (i) network security, malware, and cyber-attacks, (ii) cybercrime, data privacy, and cryptography, (iii) machine learning, social media, and artificial intelligence, and (iv) drug trafficking, cryptomarket.

The research methodology is based on the use of the method of regression analysis. Based on the representative international statistics by IMD and the UN for 2021 (60 countries), we use regression analysis to determine the dependence of the indicators of the sustainable development of the business—GDP and SDG 9—on the factors of protectionism and the use of Big Data and analytics based on AI. The reliability of the econometric modeling results is verified by determining their correspondence to the Gauss–Markov theorem. The key conclusion is that change management based on smart technologies contributes to sustainable business development, expressed in an increase in GDP and the result of SDG 9 implementation. The significance of the managerial aspect of the article is that, using the progressive methodology of SAP–LAP, we compile a SAP–LAP model of change management based on smart technologies for sustainable business development, which makes it possible to increase its flexibility and adaptability. The main result of this paper consists in the substantiation of the critical role of the flexibility of business as the main condition for its sustainable development. The paper’s novelty lies in the development of a new approach to the management of the sustainable development of the business, which specific feature is change management based on smart technologies—which ensures increased flexibility of the business.

However, the existing ready-to-use maps are characterized mainly by a coarse spatial resolution (>200 m) and information that is not up to date, making their use insufficient for the EU’s policy requirements, such as the common agricultural policy. This work, by utilizing the Soil Data Cube, which is a self-hosted custom tool, provides yearly estimations of soil thematic maps (e.g., exposed soil, soil organic carbon, clay content) covering all the agricultural area in Lithuania. The pipeline exploits various Earth observation data such as a time series of Sentinel-2 satellite imagery (2018–2022), the LUCAS (Land Use/Cover Area Frame Statistical Survey) topsoil database, the European Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) and artificial intelligence (AI) architectures to improve the prediction accuracy as well as the spatial resolution (10 m), enabling discrimination at the parcel level. Five different prediction models were tested with the convolutional neural network (CNN) model to achieve the best accuracy for both targeted indicators (SOC and clay) related to the R (Formula presented.) metric (0.51 for SOC and 0.57 for clay). The model predictions supported by the prediction uncertainties based on the PIR formula (average PIR 0.48 for SOC and 0.61 for clay) provide valuable information on the model’s interpretation and stability. The model application and the final predictions of the soil indicators were carried out based on national bare-soil-reflectance composite layers, generated by employing a pixel-based composite approach to the overlaid annual bare-soil maps and by using a combination of a series of vegetation indices such as NDVI, NBR2, and SCL.

We illustrate our insights by focusing on the practices of information seeking in everyday life, suggesting that the affordances of AI systems integrated into search engines, social media platforms, streaming services, and media generation, shape such practices in ways that may, paradoxically, result both in the increase and reduction of diversity of and access to information. We discuss the potential implications of these developments in terms of the sustainability of information ecosystems and suggest solutions for addressing them through regulation and education. Drawing from the fields of library and information science and science and technology studies and research on affordances, everyday information practices, and sustainability, the article seeks to respond to the need for more nuanced theoretical insights on the impact and implications of AI on information practices and to develop conceptual tools with which to examine the co-evolution of humans and information systems from a systemic perspective. © 2023 The Authors.

Authorities like the recently deceased scientist Stephen Hawking and the founder and ceo of Tesla, Elon Musk, see both challenges and chances in the developing artificial intelligence (A.I.). Musk remarked: “A.I. will be the best or worst thing ever for humanity” (cnbc 1 2017). The solution, Musk said, is to increase regulatory oversight of the development and implementation of A.I. immediately: “AI is a rare case where I think we need to be proactive in regulation than be reactive.” (cnbc 2 2017). Stephen Hawking emphasizes the same point: “The emergence of A.I. could be the “worst event in the history of our civilization” unless society finds a way to control its development (…). Success in creating effective A.I. could be the biggest event in the history of our civilization. Or the worst. We just don’t know.” Hawking said during a talk at the Web Summit technology conference in Lisbon, Portugal, in 2017. (cnbc 3 2017). In view of these considerations and in regard to the meaning for education in school the question arises: Which topics and competencies should be presented to pupils against the background of the rapid processing in the field of digitalization and the corresponding uncertainty of topics and competencies that could be of importance in some years and decades? Verbalized differently: What does sustainable education for our future include? The answer will be aimed at the teaching and acquirement of basic competencies in general and in the field of digitalization. What should this “basic education” include? Another question is: How is it possible to combine learning processes in a “virtual reality” with learning processes in a “natural reality”? Further considerations are given in this article. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2019.','study object',0,'AI challenges and chances for teachers and teacher education','end',NULL,NULL,NULL,'future',NULL,NULL,NULL,'Germany',0),('2-s2.0-85181176727','This article explores the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on global ecological footprints, which has important implications for global sustainability in the digital age. Using the comprehensive evaluation index of AI constructed by the entropy method and the dataset at the global national level, we find that from 2010 to 2019, the overall level of global AI shows an upward trend, in which the growth rate of AI in developed countries is more pronounced and exhibits a stable growth trend, while the growth rate of AI in developing countries displays a trend of instability. The research results show that AI has a significant inhibitory effect on ecological footprints. This conclusion holds even after endogeneity and robustness tests. In addition, under the effect of globalization, the impact of AI on ecological footprints shows nonlinear characteristics. As globalization deepens, the marginal effect of AI in reducing the ecological footprint shows an increasing trend. These findings emphasize the important role of AI in environmental governance and provide a new and comprehensive perspective for policymakers. Therefore, the government should continue to support the research and application of AI, promote the cross-industry integration of AI, and play a positive role in the process of globalization to promote global sustainable development. © 2023.

As AI continues to transform various aspects of our lives, one critical question arises for medical education: what will be the nature of education, teaching, and learning in a future world where the acquisition, retention, and application of knowledge in the traditional sense are fundamentally altered by AI? Objective: The purpose of this perspective is to plan for the intersection of health care and medical education in the future. Methods: We used GPT-4 and scenario-based strategic planning techniques to craft 4 hypothetical future worlds influenced by AI\'s integration into health care and medical education. This method, used by organizations such as Shell and the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, assesses readiness for alternative futures and effectively manages uncertainty, risk, and opportunity. The detailed scenarios provide insights into potential environments the medical profession may face and lay the foundation for hypothesis generation and idea-building regarding responsible AI implementation. Results: The following 4 worlds were created using OpenAI’s GPT model: AI Harmony, AI conflict, The world of Ecological Balance, and Existential Risk. Risks include disinformation and misinformation, loss of privacy, widening inequity, erosion of human autonomy, and ethical dilemmas. Benefits involve improved efficiency, personalized interventions, enhanced collaboration, early detection, and accelerated research. Conclusions: To ensure responsible AI use, the authors suggest focusing on 3 key areas: developing a robust ethical framework, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration, and investing in education and training. A strong ethical framework emphasizes patient safety, privacy, and autonomy while promoting equity and inclusivity. Interdisciplinary collaboration encourages cooperation among various experts in developing and implementing AI technologies, ensuring that they address the complex needs and challenges in health care and medical education. Investing in education and training prepares professionals and trainees with necessary skills and knowledge to effectively use and critically evaluate AI technologies. The integration of AI in health care and medical education presents a critical juncture between transformative advancements and significant risks. By working together to address both immediate and long-term risks and consequences, we can ensure that AI integration leads to a more equitable, sustainable, and prosperous future for both health care and medical education. As we engage with AI technologies, our collective actions will ultimately determine the state of the future of health care and medical education to harness AI\'s power while ensuring the safety and well-being of humanity. © 2023 JMIR Publications Inc.','method',0,'potential impact of AI on medical education by creating 4 hypothetical world scenarios set in 2040','means',NULL,NULL,'snapshot','future','quantitative',NULL,'OpenAI','United States of America',1),('2-s2.0-85183092676','Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has revolutionized the field of higher education, and sparked debates on the potenti al of tools such as ChatGPT, Humata.ai or Sudowrite in teaching, learning and assessment processes. While their integration in this context offers numerous opportunities (e.g., instant feedback, generation of resources and teaching materials, adaptive learning, interactivity, etc.), it also poses significant challenges that raise ethical and academic integrity concerns, such as the re liability of information, transparency regarding the sources used, or data privacy and security. The aim of this article is to examine the ethical implications of GAI in higher education from a three-fold perspective (students, faculty, and institutions). Additionally, it aims to analyze its impact on aspects related to security, accessibility, sustainability and even new forms of plagiarism and academic fraud that involve impersonation of authorship. Based on the literature review conducted, and in accordance with the ideas proposed by some authors, possibilities for integrating GAI into university classrooms will be explored. This will be achieved through pedagogical practices that guide students in the proper use of GAI and enable faculty to seek new educational approaches. This transformation process will require the establishment of clear guidelines that align with ethical codes and integrity policies of higher education institutions. Ultimately, the reflection on how to combine education, innovation, and academic integrity will provide these three groups with a new opportunity to drive improvements in university education. © (2023), (Universidad de Granada).

The change raises the question of the sustainability of education and how technology will transform the way we currently teach. This study aims to develop a model and its hypothetical adaptation that can be used to analyse the adoption and use of artificial intelligence in university settings. The importance of AI in education can be captured in its ability to personalise learning pathways, improve teaching methods and automate related administrative tasks. AI technologies are able to adapt to the needs of individual learners, providing personalised instruction and improving learning outcomes. AI can also help educators by automating routine tasks, allowing them to focus on individualised instruction and create a more engaging and effective learning environment. Based on the accepted results of exploratory factor analysis as the applied method of this paper, the research concludes that the model adaptation is feasible, but it is worth considering changing the variable reflecting implementation to one that is accepted by educators as the concrete institutional implementation of AI is still a very distant scenario in higher education. Future research should incorporate these findings into the design of possible structural models, as this area of AI research has the potential to bring significant social science and educational benefits. © 2023, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.','study object',0,'Sustainable Contribution of Artificial Intelligence to Higher Education','means','SDG4','national','snapshot','present','quantitative','Hungary',NULL,'Hungary',0),('2-s2.0-85186562725','Tourism educational institutions have been pushed towards implementing virtual learning due to the changing educational landscape and the teaching environment after COVID-19. This paper seeks to discuss the future of tourism education in the digital transformation age in Namibia post-COVID-19. A qualitative approach was used to collect data using a key informant technique. Interviews were conducted till a saturation level was reached at 20 and the data was then analysed and categorized using themes. The results show that sustainable tourism education should focus on increasing the natural environment, and ecological and cultural sustainability. The development of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technology should enable students to engage in realistic simulations of sustainable tourism practices and learn about their effects on local communities and ecosystems. Online forums and international collaborations have fostered cooperation and knowledge-sharing, allowing Namibian educators and students to absorb global best practices and add their perspectives to the conversation around sustainable tourism. However, the future of tourism education in the digital transformational age requires stable internet connectivity, increased government support and the ability of academics to deal with new students’ demands. The utilisation of digital technology to develop a more inclusive, immersive, data-driven, and globally linked learning experience is crucial for the future of sustainable tourism education in Namibia. The article concludes that sustainable tourism education will require academics to acquire new knowledge and expertise to cope with the new developments in the use of artificial intelligence and expand their area of scholarship. © 2023 AJHTL /Author(s) | Open Access – Online @ www.ajhtl.com','both',1,'Sustainable Tourism Education','both',NULL,'national','snapshot','future','qualitative','Namibia',NULL,'Malaysia',0);
